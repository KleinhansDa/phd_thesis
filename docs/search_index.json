To illustrate this, the cell can be thought of as a marble rolling down a furrowed landscape (figure 1.1). Physically a cell represents an open system, which is defined as a unit system able for external interactions. Such a system is therefore not self-dependent and self-sustained, but its current conformation is determined by external interactions. In this landscape a hill would be a high energy-, a valley a low energy state. The path the marble will take is determined by the furrows in the landscape, since it would always prefer a valley. However, this landscape is not a static structure but is a one that changes at every instant of time. Figure 1.1: Waddingtons Classical Epigenetic Landscape For developmental biology, which as a scientific discipline originates from embryology, the central interest is to understand how initially inanimate matter (like single atoms and molecules) is able to organize itself to such complex structures we see in living matter at different levels of organismal hierarchy while ensuring a robust developmental plan. Using the marble analogy, studying developmental biology can be thought of tracking multiple cells as they roll down the valley while observing and testing how interactions between them might change their fate. The basic questions arising from this interest are How do tissues arise from a population of cells? How do organs form from tissues? Why do organs form at their particular location? How do migrating cells know whether they reached their destination? How is growth controlled and how do body axes form? 1.1.1 Cell Types In animals there are two basic types of cells. Epithelial cells, which can form strong adhesions between each other and thereby are able to exert forces upon each other to achieve complex architectures. Mesenchymal cells, which do not adhere as strong with each other and are more independent. This however describes only the extremes on a continuous scale. A cell is not a binary system but can show characteristics of both extremities, e.g. during Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition (EMT), a bidirectional process whereby epithelial cells can gain migratory and invasive properties and vice versa. A cells identity on this continuum is determined by The cells profile of expressed genes, which reflects its repertoire of molecular machinery (proteins) and therefore determines its competence to react to internal and external cues. The cells micro-environment, which has a physical (forces, energy) and a chemical (signaling molecules, diluents) dimension. A change in the latter usually brings about a reaction in the cell which becomes evident both in expression of genes, which represents the programmatic adaption, and morphologically, which represents the functional adaption. The cells shape and incorporation into a tissue, which may modulate the cells affection to its micro-environment (e.g. certain regions of the cell can be more or less exposed, or it can be more or less tightly packed, tuning its susceptibility to forces and signals). With rising numbers of cells and differentiated tissue a shape and body axes begin to emerge that for the earliest developmental stages is highly similar across certain phyla and only begins to diversify at later developmental stages (figure 1.2), which reflects our evolutionary ancestry. This principle was first formulated by Ernst Haeckel as the biogenetic rule (1), which states that ontogenesis (individual development) recapitulates phylogenesis (development of phylum)^[While the biogenetic got refuted in its core (there is no complete phylogenesis in ontogenesis). It still cant be neglected that embryogenesis even of evolutionary distant species shows remarkable similarities (2). Figure 1.2: Ontogenesis across species (George Romanes, 1892) 1.1.2 Morphogenesis Morphogenesis, from the Greek morphê (shape) and genesis (creation) Beginning of the shape For objects that fulfill a purpose, many times (if not always) their forms (or shapes) are an expression of their function4. Analyzing the shape of an object can give one information about its function. It is therefore an important feature many different sciences, e.g. when correlating an organisms size to the climate it lives or when correlating intelligence to the size of an animals brain. Breaking symmetry of daughter cells often involves diversification of shape. In order to form a tissue or an organ with a variety of specialized cells, it is important for the single cell to have information about where it is located, what its neighbors are doing, how densely it is packed and what the chemical composition of its surrounding is. This is accomplished by being in constant feedback with its neighbor cells and sensation of its environment. After the information got processed, the cell will react by adjusting the levels of proteins expressed to undergo proliferation or develop specialized structures like cilia or axons. For an isolated cell, cell shape reflects a balance between cortical tension and intracellular pressure. - (4) For a cell, its present shape impacts its further specification by defining its ability in perceiving specific signals and the magnitude of signals received and transmitted (5). Shape therefore sets the general framework for cell-cell interaction and follows a scale hierarchy, where each scales output again feeds back to the others (figure 1.3). E.g. it has been shown that simple changes in cell geometry affect fundamental processes such as cell growth, death, or direction of cell divisions (612)]. Figure 1.3: Form and function feedback loops. On a cellular scale expression of genes may cause a cell to constrict, which again feeds back to the molecular scale (e.g. force transmission) and the tissue scale (e.g. evagination or constriction). All of which standing in a continuous feedback. 1.1.2.1 Apical Constriction A defining feature of Epithelial cells is they have a basal- (bottom) to apical (top) polarity. At the basal side, the cell is in contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM, a thin sheet-like structure called basement membrane in the case of epithelial cells) apically the cell forms tight connections to its neighboring cells  a region called the apical junctional complex (AJC). The AJC encompasses three types of junctions: Adherent junctions (AJ) or zonula adherens (ZA), tight junctions (TJ) and desmosomes. Around the ZA dense cables of actomyosin are found that, analog to muscle sarcomeres, are able to contract upon RHOassociated protein kinase (Rock) mediated phosphorylation of the motor protein non-muscle myosin II (NMII) (13). Apical constriction (AC) is a cell morphogenetic process manifest by an active apical narrowing, making the cell appear bottle or wedge shaped. It is usually coordinated by multiple cells within an epithelial layer that raise forces necessary to deform a tissue. Developmental processes that involve AC are Tissue folding and tube formation Single cell ingression and EMT Gastrulation Healing and sealing of embryonic tissue Epithelial rosettes are intermediate structures of radially organized cells within an epithelial tissue whose vertices interface a common center similar to a garlic bud or a pie cut into pieces along its center. While the mechanisms of cytoskeletal rearrangements seem to be well conserved, the extracellular cues that lead to rosette formation are less well understood and more diverse. At least two architectural distinct types of rosettes exist, depending on the tissues polarization. First, in a planar polarized tissue, several cells converge at a central apico-basal line with no shrinkage of the apical surface to form a cylindrical structure (like a pie cut into  4) (figure 1.4B). Such rosettes are usually observed during tissue elongation and rather short-lived. In a second scenario, cells converge to a central apical point through AC (figure 1.4A). This type of rosette is more long-lived and usually does not resolve but already represents a morphologically pre-mature state of the organ to be formed (14). Figure 1.4: Modes of constriction. A Cells converge to a central apical point B Cells converge at a central apico-basal line. 1.1.3 Cell communication To communicate with each other, cells have developed a variety of intercellular communication systems and a complex network of intracellular signal transduction pathways. Some information transfer depends on direct cell-to-cell contact, others rely on freely diffusible ligands that can be sensed by other cells. Each signaling pathway consists of a ligand  receptor pair that determines their main function. In the following, three pathways are introduced that play major roles in embryonic development. 1.1.3.1 WNT Signal transduction The word WNT is a compound word of Wingless and Int-1, both of which are important genes during development of Drosophila melanogaster (commonly known as fruit fly), where WNT signaling was first studied. WNT is evolutionary conserved with 15 different receptors and co-receptors and plays a major role during embryonic axis formation, body segmentation, organogenesis and stem cell proliferation. Aberrant WNT signaling is involved in diseases like colon cancer, melanoma and neurodegenerative diseases (15). Besides this WNT signaling is sub-divided in a canonical (\\(\\beta\\)-catenin5 dependent) and a non-canonical (\\(\\beta\\)-catenin independent) branch. In canonical signaling, WNT ligand binds, together with co-receptor Lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein 6 (LRP6), to the receptor Frizzled (Frz)  jointly activating protein Dishevelled (Dsh). Dsh again inhibits a protein complex usually degrading \\(\\beta\\)-catenin, leading to the stabilization of \\(\\beta\\)-catenin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Within the nucleus, \\(\\beta\\)-catenin forms a complex with Lef to activate specific target genes (15). 1.1.3.2 Fibroblast Growth Factor Key roles of Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is mesoderm6 patterning in the early embryo, regulation of angiogenesis and wound repair. On a cellular level it is also an important regulator of proliferation and differentiation. The mammalian FGF family is comprised of 18 ligands and four highly conserved transmembrane tyrosine kinases named FGF receptor 1-4 (FGFR1-4). Aberrant FGF signaling is e.g. associated with tumor growth (16). Upon ligand binding FGFR dimerizes and undergoes a conformational shift activating the intracellular kinase7 domain. Subsequent trans-phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase domains serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins. Activated FGFR then phosphorylates FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2), recruiting adaptor protein Son of Sevenless (SoS) and Growth factor Receptor bound 2 (GRb2) to set on a cascade of kinase dependent signal transduction eventually leading to activation of target genes involved in the regulation of e.g. proliferation, autophagy and EMT (16). At least one developmental process requires a locally confined and very enriched source of signaling molecules. It was shown that rosette formation in the lateral line primordium (LLP) is an important morphological feature for a lumen to form on top of the rosette which, filled with FGF, acts as a locally enriched source of FGF signaling (17). 1.1.3.3 Lateral Inhibition In neurobiology the term lateral inhibition describes the process of an excited neuron reducing the activity of its neighbors. The same principle however can be found in other types of cells too where one cell signals its neighbor cell(s) not to do something. For initially equivalent cells to diversify and acquire distinct identities there needs to be a break in symmetry. Often this is accomplished by competition about Notch signaling sources where whichever cell expresses a trait first is able to suppress the same in its surrounding cells. Once this hierarchy is established, it is maintained in a positive feedback manner (18, 19). Notch signaling gives cells the ability to self-organize and controls various developmental and homeostatic processes that involve patterning, such as sensory hair cell (HC) formation, branched arterial networks or organ morphogenesis. Notch signaling consists of four components: (1) The extracellular domain of the membrane bound Notch receptor (2) Notch ligands (3) the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (4) and the \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase. Upon ligand activation of Notch through Delta, NICD is cleaved and released through \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase. Subsequently NICD enters the nucleus and together with DNA-binding proteins and co-factors initiates expression of target genes. In contrast to other signaling pathways there are no intermediates between membrane signaling and nucleus and therefore no amplification or dampening of the signal occurs signaling requires direct contact between cells, which makes Notch signaling particularly biased by features of cellular morphology and tissue organization (18). Assuming a homogeneous receptor concentration in a cells membrane and since Notch signaling occurs at sites where cells are in contact, the signal generated is proportional to the contact area. Additionally, the strength of the signal increases further where cells are tightly opposed, such as sites of apical constriction (5, 18, 20, 21). 1.2 Model Organism and System To discover biological phenomena, biologists use a variety of non-human model organism species. While each model organism has its advantages and disadvantages, the choice for a particular model depends on the scientific question. To study embryonic development the fresh water fish Danio rerio (also known as eng: zebrafish or ger: zebrabärbling (figure1.5)) has become an important model organism over the recent years. D.rerio is a diploid organism with a fully sequenced genome (of the human genes 71.4% have at least one D.rerio ortholog, 47% have a one-to-one ortholog (22). It has a relatively short alternation of generations (12-16 weeks), a regularly large number of embryos (100 / week / female) and is relatively undemanding in terms of space for breeding and time for maturation. Furthermore, it offers well-established methods for mutagenesis, screening and generation of transgenic lines. Since its embryos are naturally transparent and develop ex utero, its an ideal system for microscopic examination using molecular dyes and tags to visualize inter and intra cellular components even deep within the tissue (e.g. cell nuclei or cell membrane fluorescent tags). Together with advances in imaging techniques, this also allows for high-throughput, high-resolution, long-term in vivo imaging. Especially the combination of organ or tissue specific fluorescent makers like Green- or Red fluorescent protein (G- or RFP) and observation of pre-larval stages, where the embryo is still transparent, offers enormous possibilities to address interesting and long standing open questions. In nature, zebrafish can be found in the shallow waters of the Indian and Pakistan Ganges inflows. It exhibits an oval body shape and can reach a length of up to 5 cm in adulthood. While females are usually more silverish, males have a brownish back and a yellow-whit belly. Laterally it exhibits its name-giving dark-blue iridescent stripes with silver in between. Figure 1.5: Model organism Danio rerio (aquarell by Christine Molenda) 1.2.1 Developmental Stages A single female may lay up to 100 fertilized eggs. Each Zygote8 then undergoes the first zygotic cell cycle (at ~ 0.75 h). The following two to seven cell cycles (period: Cleavage, at ~ 2.25 h) occur directed and synchronous every ~15 min. Cells in this stage are called blastomeres and are incompletely separated from the blastoderm (the collective of blastomeres) and remain interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges. The Blastula period (up to 5.25 h) is determined by increasingly asynchronous division, flattening of the blastoderm and lengthening of the cell cycle. This period is also marked by the onset of epiboly9 (23). After Blastula and until 10 h the Gastrula period takes place, followed by the Segmentation period (until 24 h). Both of which are depicted in more detail in figure 1.6. At even later stages the embryo starts to elongate posteriorly, grow in size and develop organs until it first active muscle are present and it starts to swim (figure 1.6). Figure 1.6: Zebrafish embryonic development. Microscopic images are from a time-lapse where 24 embryos were imaged simultaneously in brightfield and at 488 nm Z-Stacks. Representation shows contrast enhanced EDFs. Bottom row (30-48 hpf) stages are handmade drawings from live embryos made during the first week of my PhD. 1.2.2 The Lateral Line System The lateral line (LL) system is a mechano-sensory organ that is common to all aquatic vertebrates. It enables the animal to sense water movements and therefore to orient itself, and to detect prey and predators. Fully developed, the lateral line system is comprised of hundreds of neuromasts positioned in an orderly pattern all over the animals body (figure 1.7A). Its functional subunits are the neuromasts (NM) (figure 1.7B-C) that, when fully developed, consist of hair-, support- and mantle cells. To sense water movements, each NM projects kinocilia out of the skin that, upon water induced deflection, generate action potentials that are transduced via afferent and efferent fibers (24, 25). Figure 1.7: The lateral line system. A modified after (Ghysen et al., 2012) and A.Bergs, 2016 (student presentation at AK Lecaudey). Development of the later line system at embryonic, larval and juvenile stage. B Schematic showing a crossection and organization of a single neuromast. C-C SEM images of a single, pre-mature (3 dpf) neuromast. Each NM is first deposited as a premature cluster of about 30 cells from a migrating cell-aggregate called the posterior lateral line primordium (pLLP) 1.8A. The pLLP delaminates from the pLL placode, caudal to the otic vesicle (figure 1.8B) at around 20 hours post fertilization (hpf) as a group of ~100 cells. After formation of the leading region with cells undergoing a partial EMT, it starts migrating along a chemokine gradient positioned at the horizontal myoseptum to the tip of the tail (figure ??) (24, 25). To ensure the development of a functional organ, several fundamental biological processes like cell migration, morphogenesis, proliferation and cell polarization need to be integrated into the pLLP. An important breakthrough in LL research has been the development of a transgenic line expressing a membrane tethered GFP fusion protein (lyn-GFP) that is expressed under the LL specific promotor of cldnb (claudin b10) (26), which allowed for a much more detailed view and to observe lateral line development in vivo. An example of the fluorescence signal visible at ~60 hpf can be seen in figure 1.8B. Figure 1.8: Neuromast deposition and pattern A Scheme showing NM deposition over three timepoints (10 min. interval). Dotted lines are time-tracks of rosettes, which become more concentrated over time. Bottom arrow indicates regions of rosette formation, maturation and deposition within the pLLP (scale bar = 20 µm; 20X WI; ~20 Z-planes; 2.5 µm spacing. MaxIP. Colors inverted.) B Scheme showing the lateral line at end of migration (~60 hpf) and other parts visible through the cldnb:lyn-gfp transgene (as documented through zfin.org) (air objective + 1.5X tube lens; four tiles; ~20 Z-planes; 5 µm spacing. MaxIP. Colors inverted). 1.2.3 Posterior Lateral Line Primordium The pLLP is about 100-150 \\(\\mu\\)m in length (depending on deposition cycle) over which it exhibits a diverse surface topology and cellular morphology. Previous research found that the caudal (also posterior), more mesenchymal cells, are leading the path of migration, while the cranial (also anterior), more epithelial cells, are trailing. Towards the leading region the cells are more flat, towards the trailing region the cells become more columnar and increasingly radially organized into formations called epithelial rosettes. During migration the pLLP typically contains 2-3 rosettes (~25-30 cells each), while the most trailing one will eventually be deposited to further mature to a functional NM (24, 27). Every deposition comes with a loss of cells in the pLLP, but this loss is partially compensated by proliferation during migration. While one study concludes a general spatial heterogeneity in distribution of proliferative cells (28), another one suggests a higher proliferative rate specifically near the leading region (29). 1.2.3.1 Rosette formation The onset of morphological and functional changes is determined by signaling of FGF, which is mostly active in the trailing region. Causal for expression of FGF is a signaling center of WNT in the leading region, which promotes expression of FGF ligands FGF-3 and -10 (30). Those ligands then diffuse to the trailing domain where binding through FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) triggers a signaling cascade through which the cells become more columnar, apically constricted and eventually re-organize into epithelial rosettes (29, 31, 32). Concurrently, cells of the Wnt signaling center themselves are not competent to FGF signaling, which is achieved through expression of Sef, an intracellular antagonist to FGFR1 signaling (33). 1.2.3.2 Hair cell specification Downstream of FGF lies the expression of transcription factor (TF) Atoh1a, which gives cells the potential to become sensory HCs (29). The current model suggests that (1) FGF initiates expression of atoh1a and deltaA, where DeltaA activates Notch in neighboring cells to inhibit expression of atoh1a in those. (2) Atoh1a in turn suppresses competence for FGF and initiates expression of atoh1b and deltaD. (3) While the latter acts synergistic with DeltaA, Atoh1b again drives expression of atoh1a (34). (4) Once a prospective HC is specified it will itself become a source for FGF-10. By this process adjacent cells are laterally inhibited and determined support cells (figure 1.7B), still capable of receiving FGF signals. Just before the most trailing rosette is deposited, its prospective HC will undergo a final division to form a doublet of sensory HCs that will orient orthogonal to planar polarity and establish mirror symmetry in maturing neuromasts (35, 36). 1.2.4 Shroom3 in the pLLP The Shroom protein family is conserved through evolution (figure A.6) and involved in contraction of the actomyosin network (e.g. during AC), which has been confirmed in several studies investigating e.g. epithelial planar remodeling, neural tube morphogenesis and Xenopus bottle cells (3742). 1.2.4.1 Recent research Shroom proteins have three characteristic domains (1) a PDZ domain close to the N-terminus to interact with other proteins with PDZ-binding domains and (2) two Apx/Shroom domains (ASD1 and 2), the latter being close to the proteins C-terminus. The Shroom domains may interact with proteins containing a Shroom binding domain (SBD) such as Rock to help and facilitate phosphorylation of NMII (figure 1.9) (43). Figure 1.9: Shroom3 functional domains and mode of operation. Sequence of events numbered from 1-4. Approximate scale jumps indicated at arrows. While in all of the above-mentioned studies Shroom3 was the focus of interest, in zebrafish and most other model organisms there are four paralogs. A previous study performed by a lab-mate done on Shroom3 morphants in D.rerio (44) indicates that Shroom3 is also necessary for AC and rosette formation in the migrating pLLP. In summary we were able to show and that Shroom3 is expressed in the pLLP from stages 24  48 hpf. shroom3 is expressed downstream of FGF signaling, which was confirmed via treatment with an FGFR1 inhibiting drug. Subsequent ISH with the Probe used before showed that the signal was gone in Morpholino (MO) injected embryos. The drug used has been used before (SU5402) in the same context (29, 32). In these it was found that SU5402 has the ability to prevent rosette formation, but not to dismantle already established ones. Shroom3 localizes to rosette centers, which was accomplished by inserting a genetic construct where a shroom3-tagRFP fusion protein is under control of a heat-shock11 promotor into a cldnb:lyn-GFP transgenic line. This way they were able to ectopically express shroom3-tRFP and confirm its localization by confocal fluorescence microscopy (figure 1.10A). Rosette formation is impaired in MO injected embryos, which was confirmed quantitatively by using a specifically trained rosette detector (45) to count and weight single rosettes. As a metric to compare whole pLLPs the sum of weights as in \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{i-n}{weighted\\ detections}\\) was used (figure 1.10B-B).12 Figure 1.10: Shroom3 in rosette formation (adapted from Ernst et al., 2012) A composite MaxIPs of membrane label and fusion protein showing the localization of Shroom within the pLLP B uninjected control and shroom3 MO injected MaxIPs B Heat-maps of rosette detector score. 1.2.4.2 Current Model Based on these and previous results, the current model for apical constriction in the pLLP assumes that (1) expression of shroom3 is induced by FGF signaling (2) Shroom3 binds Rock and translocates it to the AJC to (3) mediate phosphorylation of NMII which (3) induces contraction of the actin network and AC (figure 1.11). Furthermore, AC is necessary for rosette assembly and subsequent NM deposition. In conclusion the current understanding is that without Shroom3 AC can not take place and rosette formation does not occur, therefore NMs are not deposited. Figure 1.11: Shroom3 current model 1.2.5 shroom3 mutants In this scenario, the advantages of working with a knockout- as compared to a knockdown13 mutant are (1) an equal amount of gene expression across all samples (2) no side effects due to injection procedure or solvents in drug treatments (3) the ability to observe the effects of the mutation for very long periods of time. The strategy for the mutant was to inhibit interaction with SBD-domain proteins. Furthermore, the mutant should be easily genotyped by amplifying a fragment of the gene via PCR and correlating gel electrophoresis band patterns after a restrictive digest. To achieve this, shroom3 was targeted using a genome editing system based on the Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) (46). Following, embryos were screened for mutations resulting in one with a 7 bp deletion in Shroom Domain (SD) 1 and one with an 8 bp deletion in SD 2 that would prevent interaction with Shroom binding domain (SBD) proteins or even lead to a NULL mutation14. Further analysis showed that the 8 bp mutation in SD2 resulted in (1) a phenotype reminiscent to the MO-injected embryos, (2) a shift in the open reading frame and (3) a deletion of a restriction site for a restion enzyme named NsiI.7p@m 1.3 Open Questions and Motivation The LL phenotype at later stages revealed discrepancies with the current model of rosette formation and the role of Shroom3 during LL development. One aspect about LL development that still remains unclear are the exact factors that lead to cell cluster (CC) deposition. What determines the timing of deposition? When is a rosette mature enough to be deposited? What happens to the cells before and after deposition? How do the cells specify before deposition? What are the morphological features of depositing cells? What influence does morphology have on Neuromast deposition? Using the Shroom3 mutants as a model system offers great potential to shed new light on organogenesis, the interplay between morphogenesis and cellular specification, epithelial rosette formation and neuromast deposition. Another great advantage of zebrafish as a model system is the relatively high number of offspring and samples that could theoretically be used for experiments. Current (live) imaging sample preparation techniques however are a limiting factor in making use of this circumstance. They lack both precision as well as the amount of samples that can be mounted to image them simultaneously. Therefore. for high content screening of zebrafish embryos a new sample preparation technique was developed. Even though the expression Form follows function (3) is usually found in design and architecture, it formulates the general idea that any objects form is (or in design should) be shaped by the requirements to it. catenins are regulators of cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription one of the earliest differentiating layer of cells.

Since the advent of electronic imaging techniques15 scientific image data can be processed and analyzed in silico. To make use of the possibility of live imaging, which (as compared to fixation techniques) conserves the cellular integrity and morphology while also offers the possibility of recording time-lapses the optically clear specimen and high throughput image analysis and state-of-the-art data science using algorithmic implementations, the three following points were paid special attention to. 2.2.1.1 Sample Preparation For fluorescence microscopy zebrafish embryos are usually immersed in a 1% solution of low melting-point agarose (LMPA) solution and then oriented on an optical cover slip manually until the LMPA has solidified. This process allows to mount16 eight to ten embryos per dish. To make use of the high number of offspring a single zebrafish female may lay, which rapidly leads to a sample number of more than 300, a new sample preparation technique was devised that allows for (1) a four to five times increase in samples per dish (2) a facilitated navigation via a grid-like orientation through the samples and (3) an improved spatial orientation where the embryos body axes are aligned parallel to the optical Z-sections of the confocal microscope. For details, see Materials and Methods section 2.2.3.5 and Kleinhans et al., 2019(51). 2.2.1.2 Imaging Technically, speed and sensitivity are most important for live imaging. Considering these two parameters a light-sheet (52) fluorescence microscope (LSFM) would be the best fit. However, LSFMs also have several limitations. First, due to the sample preparation methods available the number of samples that can be imaged at a time is highly restricted. Second, for subcellular resolution a high magnification is required, which is limited by working distances and third - for optimal image analysis a high Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and numerical aperture (N.A.) is preferable. Therefore a spinning disc (53) system was chosen for most of the imaging. The system makes use of (1) an extra-large field of view (FOV) ideal for large specimen (2) the possibility of a high degree of automation with state-of-the-art software and (3) a water dispension system for long-term water immersion imaging. For details about the system see Materials and Methods section 2.1.10.2. 2.2.1.3 Data handling Subsequently after data acquisition and pre-processing the image data was transferred from the microscope system to the labs main workstation. To uniquely identify each file and have them appear in a structured manner, a file-naming system was established after the following structure Where stage would e.g. be 32hpf, group would be a genotype or drug treatment, id would be a positional identifier on an imaging dish like B1P0117 and date would be a date in the form of YYMMDD. 2.2.1.4 Image and Data Analysis In order to be as objective an as high throughput as possible, almost all of the analyses performed for this study was solved using either algorithmically or state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Furthermore, to meet the terms and conditions of open science18 standards, all pipelines were implemented in open source software frameworks such as Fiji is just image J (FIJI) and R. For further information about training datasets, algorithms and versions used see Materials and Methods section 2.1.11. 2.2.2 Zebrafish 2.2.2.1 Husbandry Zebrash husbandry was maintained at the University of Frankfurt am Main. All legal procedures were followed while handling and maintaining zebrash husbandry. All zebrash lines used in and generated for this study are listed in the Appendix A. 2.2.2.2 Handling and rearing In the afternoon preceding the embryo collection, 1 male and female were set up in crossing cages, physically separated by a transparent separator. Next day, before noon, separators were removed allowing fertilization. Fertilized eggs were then collected, sorted and reared in the well-defined culture medium E3 (Kimmel et.al. 1995, section 2.1.6) at 25\\(^\\circ\\), 28.5\\(^\\circ\\), or 30\\(^\\circ\\) Celsius depending on the experimental condition required. To grow larvae to the adulthood, they were transferred to the system on day 5. Till day 12, larvae were fed Vinegar Eels, Paramecia, and Caviar powder. After the 12 th day, water supply was started and fish were fed Brine Shrimp, Artemia, Paramecia and Vinegar Eels. Adult fish (&gt;1 Month) were fed Artemia and the dry flakes. 2.2.2.3 Zebrafish fin clips Adult sh were anesthetized with buered Tricaine (1X, see section 2.1.6) until. About 1/3 rd of the caudal n was cut with a sterile scalpel in a sterile Petri Dish. Immediately the cut n was transferred to 50 mM NaOH. Fish were returned to system water and kept in 1L system water in single tanks with 200 \\(\\mu\\)L of 0.01\\(\\%\\) Methylene Blue. 2.2.2.4 Adult Genotyping The clipped fins were digested for 1 h at 95\\(^\\circ\\) Celsius and neutralized subsequently with 1M Tris-HCl of (pH 9). 2.2.2.5 Embryo Genotyping Single fixed/live embryos were denatured at 95\\(^\\circ\\) Celsius in 50mM NaOH for 1 hour and neutralized by adding 1/10 the volume of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.2). 2.2.2.6 Zebrafish Euthanasia Adult zebrafish were anesthetized in tricaine (1X) till stage II-III of anaestezia and put in the ice cold water so as to sacrifice them by hypothermia. 2.2.2.7 Fixation Embryos and dechorionated larvae were fixed in 2 ml of 4\\(\\%\\) PFA in 1X PBS overnight at 4\\(^\\circ\\) Celsius. 2.2.3 Wet lab 2.2.3.1 Sample preparation For samples later than 24 hpf, embryos were grown in 1X PTU till desired stage and treated with 150 \\(\\mu\\)L per 10 mL of 0.1 mg/mL Pronase for ~30 min.. Choria were removed by gentle pipetting with a 2 mL plastic pasteur pipette. To replace the Pronase solution with fresh E3, embryos were immobilized by anesthesia and collected in the center of the dish by gentle rotational movement. Then the medium was poured away by collecting the embryos at the corner bottom of the dish while taking care not to loose any. After, the dish was filled with fresh E3. This process was repeated three times. For samples earlier than 18s, embryos were treated with 150 \\(\\mu\\)L per 10 mL of 0.1 mg/mL Pronase directly. Choria were removed the same way as for &gt; 24 hpf embryos but when pouring away the Pronase solution, the dish was simultaneously and very carefully filled with fresh E3 again. Since younger embryos are more fragile and to avoid damage, they must be kept in solution constantly. Fixation started at the desired stage in 4% PFA in 0.1% PBST at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C o.n.. The next day, samples were rinsed 3 times for ~5 min. in PBST and passed through a MeOH series of 25\\(\\%\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 50\\(\\%\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 75\\(\\%\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 100\\(\\%\\) MeOH/PBST (V/V)). For permanent storage, samples were stored in 100\\(\\%\\) MeOH at -20\\(^\\circ\\)C. 2.2.3.2 Plasmid preparation To remove solvent and medium, in a 1.5 or 2 mL tube, the bacteria were centrifuged in 2 mL tubes for 3 min. at 12000 rpm. To solve the pellet, the supernatant was discarded by pouring on a tissue and 200 \\(\\mu\\)L of buffer P1 were added followed by thorough vortexing. To lyse the bacteria 400 \\(\\mu\\)L of P2 were added, standing still. After a maximum of 5 min. 300 \\(\\mu\\)L of P3 were added to neutralize the reaction and bind cellular material, and the tube was inverted five to six times. To harvest the plasmid DNA the solution was then first centrifuged for 10 min. at 12000 rpm and at RT. After, the supernatant was transferred to a new 2 mL tube. Second, to precipitate the DNA, 700 \\(\\mu\\)L of iso-propanol were added and centrifuged for 20 min. at full speed and at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. After, the tube was checked for a opaque pellet and the supernatant was discarded. Third, to wash the pellet, 200 \\(\\mu\\)L of 70\\(%\\) EtOH were added and centrifuged for 7 min. at full speed and at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. The supernatant was discarded again. Finally, the pellet was air dryed under the hood and re-suspended in 50 \\(\\mu\\)L ddHO. 2.2.3.3 In Situ Hybridization Sample preparation as described in section 2.2.3.1. 2.2.3.3.1 1. Permeabilisation &amp; Probe Hybridization Permeabilisation \\(\\rightarrow\\) without shaking Samples were rehydrated in an inverse MeOH series of 75\\(\\%\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 50\\(\\%\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 25\\(\\%\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 0\\(\\%\\) PBST and washed again for 5 min. two times in pure PBST. Finally, samples were digested in 10 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL Proteinase K according to table 2.15. Table 2.15: Proteinase K digestion Stage 0.6 s 7 s 18 s 24 hpf 32 hpf 36 hpf 42 hpf 48 hpf 72 hpf min. 0 4 6 15 30 40 50 60 60 Samples were washed again for 5 min. two times in PBST and post-fixated in 4\\(\\%\\) PFA at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C for &gt; 30 min. Samples were washed again for 5 min. three times in PBST. Probe Hybridisation \\(\\rightarrow\\) all steps at 60\\(^\\circ\\)C, except stated differently Samples were pre-hybridized in 350 \\(\\mu\\)L of hybridization buffer (section 2.1.6) for 1 - 8 h. Just before detection probe treatment, the probe was denatured at 80\\(^\\circ\\)C in 1:200 of hybridization buffer. Subsequently, hybridization buffer was taken off the samples and replaced with the heated probe. Finally, samples were incubated o.n. at a desired temperature (around 65\\(^\\circ\\)C). 2.2.3.3.2 2. Probe removal &amp; Antibody incubation The next day the probe got collected and stored at -20\\(^\\circ\\)C for re-use. Washing took place at the same temperature as hybridization (from step 1) To keep solutions at temperature a Thermo-Block was used. For the washing series the samples were first washed one time for 20 min. in hybridization buffer, then two times for 30 min. in 50\\(\\%\\) Formamide and one time for 20 min. in 25\\(\\%\\) Formamide. Then two times for 15 min. in 2X SSCT and two times for 30 min. in 0.2X SSCT. Finally, one time for 5 min. in TNT. To reduce noise and increase specific signal strength, the samples were treated with blocking solution (section 2.1.6) for 1 - 8 h in 350 \\(\\mu\\)L of 2% BR/TNT at room temperature (RT). Afterwards the samples were incubated in 100 \\(\\mu\\)L Anti-Digoxigenin diluted in NTMT buffer (1/4000 (V/V)) in 2\\(\\%\\) BR/TNT for 2 h at RT or o.n. at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. 2.2.3.3.3 3. Probe detection First, the samples were washed six times for ~20 min. (or one wash o.n.) in TNT and two times for ~ 5min. in NTMT. After washing, color staining was performed with 4.5 NBT \\(\\mu\\)L + 3.5 \\(\\mu\\)L BCIP per mL NTMT in the dark and at RT without shaking (in a drawer) for 2 - 8 h, regularly checking the progression of the reaction. As soon as an appropriate degree of color intensity on the target site was achieved (up to two days), the samples were again washed three times in PBST. Afterwards the samples were either prepared for immunostaining or imaging. For permanent storage samples were kept in 50\\(\\%\\) Glycerol at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. 2.2.3.4 Immuno staining Sample preparation as described in section 2.2.3.1. First, samples were blocked in 2\\(\\%\\) Goat Serum / PBDT (V/V) for 30 min.. For protein target site detection, a primary antibody (150 \\(\\mu\\)L of 2% NGS / PBDT (V/V)) was incubated for ~2 h at RT or o.n. at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. Samples were washed for 2 h in PBDT while changing the solution 5 - 6 times. To stain the now bound primary antibody, a secondary antibody (150 \\(\\mu\\)L of 2% NGS / PBDT (V/V)) was incubated for 2 h at RT or o.n. at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. Samples were washed for 2 h in PBDT while changing the solution 5 - 6 times. 2.2.3.5 Mounting For mounting, an improved 3D specimen preparation and well-plate like sample navigation for zebrafish larvae confocal microscopy was developed which offers the following improvements To obtain a sufficient amount of data that is closely staged and still comprises &gt; 4 independent groups. Using this protocol, it is possible to define a custom well plate in your preferred imaging software, which greatly facilitates the imaging procedure and therefore helps to stay focused. However, once the well plate is aligned and the positions are defined it still needs some minor correction in Z. To do the imaging live. Most of the time, especially in morphological analyses, live imaging is preferred since any fixation alters cell - and therefore organ morphology. Live imaging guarantees an undisturbed and unbiased look at the in vivo situation. Using this protocol, the embryonic body axes will be more in line with the XY displacement of the microscope stage which results, depending on the volume of interest, in narrower Z-stacks. This ultimately also leads to a reduction of photo-bleaching, phototoxicity and expenditure of time. The gained time can then be used to image shorter time-intervals in timelapse imaging. To reduce background signal and noise. Instead of transforming and aligning the image data in a post-processing approach, the specimen can be imaged in the right spacial configuration in the first place. This is not only important for 3D analysis, but also for Z projected data. If the specimen body axes are not aligned with the axes of the microscopic table, the image stacks need to be bigger to record the volume of interest. In Z projections, for X Y coordinates out of the volume of interest, this will end up as background signal or noise, complicating quantitative analysis and interpretation. The method therefore provides significant improvement over existing mounting techniques. 2.2.3.5.1 Protocol Figure 2.1: Stamping procedure Agarose Cast (A) clean stamp surface (B) preparation of the stamp before lifting (C) ready-for-use agarose imprint.

Each of them is specifically designed for input of LL and pLLP images of the cldnb:lyn-gfp transgenic line. Hence, they are called anaLLzr  2D - analysis of Z-projected images of the LL at end of migration 2DT - analysis of Z-projected images of the LL during migration 3D - analysis of 3D image stacks of the pLLP at a given timepoint 2.2.4.1.1 anaLLzr2D From the opening dialog (figure 2.6) the user can choose to count nuclei and / or sort ROIs. If nuclei count is chosen, the macro expects a dual-channel tiff-file as input. If ROI sorting is selected, segmented CCs are numbered and sorted from left to right instead of IJs native sorting method (from top to bottom). Slider values are optimized for the the microscope setup described in section 2.1.10.2. Membrane label blur controls the detail of pLLP and CC segmentation, where lower values result in more detail Closing filter controls how harsh objects are separated from each other Nuclei label blur controls the details of single nuclei and is evaluated after ground truth data described in section 2.3 Figure 2.6: anaLLzR2D opening dialog checkboxes Choose to count nuclei and whether ROIs sorting should be applied. sliders Choose filter and blurring levels. Code-snippets describing the main functionality are described in the next couple of sub-sections. 2.2.4.1.1.1 Segmentation The membrane labeled image is segmented based on optimized hard coded values which are based on experience. After, the macro halts for manual correction. # Background subtraction run(&quot;Subtract Background...&quot;, &quot;rolling = 50&quot;); run(&quot;Morphological Filters&quot;, &quot;operation = Opening element = Disk radius = 20&quot;); run(&quot;Gaussian Blur...&quot;, &quot;sigma = 5 scaled&quot;); # Thresholding setAutoThreshold(&quot;Moments dark&quot;); setOption(&quot;BlackBackground&quot;, false); run(&quot;Convert to Mask&quot;); # Particle analysis run(&quot;Analyze Particles...&quot;, &quot;size = 250-Infinity exclude add&quot;); roiManager(&quot;Show All without labels&quot;); run(&quot;Enhance Contrast&quot;, &quot;saturated = 0.35&quot;); waitForUser(&quot;Check ROIs, correct if necessary&quot;); if (sort) { sortROIs(); } 2.2.4.1.1.2 Sorting To sort manually corrected ROIs from left to right, each ROIs position in calculated relatively to total image width. # Sort ROIs from left to right function sortROIs() { run(&quot;Set Measurements...&quot;, &quot;centroid redirect = None decimal = 0&quot;); for (j = 0 ; j&lt;roiManager(&quot;count&quot;); j++) { roiManager(&quot;select&quot;, j); roiManager(&quot;measure&quot;); x = getResult(&quot;X&quot;, 0); w = getWidth(); a = x/w; roiManager(&quot;rename&quot;, a); run(&quot;Clear Results&quot;); } setBatchMode(false); roiManager(&quot;sort&quot;); for (j = 0 ; j &lt; roiManager(&quot;count&quot;); j++) { roiManager(&quot;select&quot;, j); roiManager(&quot;rename&quot;, j); run(&quot;Clear Results&quot;); } for (j = 0 ; j &lt; roiManager(&quot;count&quot;); j++) { roiManager(&quot;select&quot;, j); roiManager(&quot;rename&quot;, j+1); run(&quot;Clear Results&quot;); } } 2.2.4.1.1.3 Count nuclei After smoothing the nuclei signal in the DAPI labeled channel, maxima are detected only within each ROI. # count nuclei within segmented cell clusters # steps performed on DAPI channel # count nuclei run(&quot;Gaussian Blur...&quot;, &quot;sigma = 0.6 scaled&quot;); roiManager(&quot;open&quot;, datdir + filename + &quot;_ROIset.zip&quot;); rcount = roiManager(&quot;count&quot;); # for each ROI for (j = 0 ; j &lt; rcount; j++) { roiManager(&quot;open&quot;, datdir + filename + &quot;_ROIset.zip&quot;); roiManager(&quot;select&quot;, j); run(&quot;Duplicate...&quot;, &quot; &quot;); run(&quot;Enhance Contrast&quot;, &quot;saturated = 0.35&quot;); run(&quot;Find Maxima...&quot;, &quot;noise = 0 output = [Point Selection]&quot;); run(&quot;Capture Image&quot;); roiManager(&quot;select&quot;, j); run(&quot;Find Maxima...&quot;, &quot;noise = 0 output = Count&quot;); NC = getResult(&quot;Count&quot;); setResult(&quot;Nuclei&quot;, j, NC); setResult(&quot;Pos&quot;, j, j + 1); } 2.2.4.1.2 anaLLzR2DT Upon macro execution the opening dialog is presented which is divided in three sections (figure 2.7A). In the processing section the user may choose which modules are executed. Segmentation controls whether the images are segmented before measurement. If de-seleted the user has to provide segmentation masks seperately. Include Cell Clusters controls whether Cell Clusters should be included in the analysis. If de-selected, only the pLLP will be considered. Registration controls whether the pLLP should be captured in time and space and saved in a separate stack. Multichannel controls whether on a second channel summary statistics from each ROI at each timepoint should be taken. measurements taken are the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum intensity In the options section the user may choose whether the macro should be run in headless mode (without showing every single action), whether the input images are timeseries and whether all other windows should be closed upon start of processing. After confirmation, the user has to enter a date of experiment as an identifier in a second dialog. Furthermore the user is presented the images physical properties pre-filled where the idea here is just a review since this is a major source of mistakes.

In the processing section the user has to define the input format as well as in which direction the Z-stack was recorded. Furthermore, the user may choose choose to have the pLLP registered, save intermediate steps for debugging and to have objects segmented without any restrictions and manual ROI correction. In the thresholds section the user may fine tune segmentation and filter levels Segmentation controls the segmentation threshold at which the membrane signal is detected, cell volumes are seperated from each other and is evaluated after ground truth data described in section 2.3 Min. volume controls the minimum volume, below which objects are discarded Max. volume controls the maximum volume, above which objects are discarded In the measurements section the user may choose may choose whether apical constriction measurement should be applied or not. In case apical constriction measurement was selected the user may choose whether ACI should be measured at an absolute- or relative- distance from the tip. Furthermore, the user has the option to measure from a fit ellipsoid or rectangle.

} } } 2.2.4.2 Rosette Detection The method used for rosette detection is based on a convolutional neuronal network (CNN) and was modified from the rosette detector algorithm previously used in the lab and described in (44, 45). Since the former method was technically outdated and since we had new data in which we needed to detect rosettes, we updated the former method to a state-of-the-art CNN using Caffe(54) as a backend. Network configuration and training was done by our collaborators at the institute for Informatics, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg. The training dataset consitsts of 17 DMSO- and SU5402- treated embryos each. SU5402 is an inhibitor of FGF receptors and embryos treated with these inhibitors show a strongly reduced number of rosettes ((32)). In order to give the network something to learn, the data had to be labeled manually, which was done in ImageJ by placing multipoint ROIs at the center of the rosettes. The data was then further permutated to artificially increase the amount of training data and make the detection more robust against different kinds of input. Further parameters about the training data is listed in Table 2.16. One example for each is shown in figure ??. The main advantages for using a neural network in a task like this are Objectivity A computer model is not biased in a way that it prefers one outcome over the other. It evaluates based on what it was trained to. Unlike the human brain, once a CNN is trained it is static and does not keep on learning. Degree of rosette registration The output data are continous rational numbers (\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)) instead of integers (\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)) which does not only tell if a rosette is there fore not, but also for how much (50-100\\(\\%\\)) it is there. Training is done relatively quick Table 2.16: CNN training data group conc. nm intensity. exposure z.planes magnification DMSO 0.1\\(\\%\\) 488 100 100 ms ~70 40X SU5402 10\\(\\mu\\)M 488 100 100 ms ~70 40X 2.2.4.3 Proliferation Analysis The basic principle is based on work done by Laguerre et al., 2009(28). For registration of mitotic events an IJ manual tracking tool was used was used that allows to track an image feature through a stack of images creating tracks as it progresses through volume / time (MTrackJ(55)). For mounting the procedure described in section 2.2.3.5 was used. Nuclei were visualized in a cxcr4b(BAC):H2BRFP transgenic line. Z-projection of volumetric timelapses, Mitotic events were tracked in each CC and the pLLP. Afterwards the data was exported as one table per embryo and processes by counting mitoses per pLLP / CC / total CC mitoses per embryo. Figure ?? shows an exemplary track for the data analyzed. 2.2.4.4 Apical Index 2.2.4.4.1 Rationale The earliest attempt found for indexing AC can be found in a study published by Lee et al(56) where they were interested in the apical index (A.I.) of bottle cells during X.laevis gastrulation(figure ?? Lee). Another example for measuring AC is the apical constriction index (ACI, figure ?? Harding) for the cells of the D.rerio lateral line primordium (pLLP), which can be found in a study from 2012 where it was shown that Fgfr-Ras-MAPK signaling is required for AC and Rock2a localization (57, 58). In these two publications, the way they measure A.I. (56) and ACI (58) respectively, does not differ and is the ratio of lateral height over apical width. \\[\\mathbf{ACI} = \\frac{lateral\\;height\\;[\\mu m]}{apical\\;width\\;[\\mu m]}\\] We found two principal weaknesses of applying this ratio to the cells of the PLLp. First, it does not respect the independence of lateral height to AC. Second, it does not differentiate between anterio-posterior (AP) and dorso-ventral (DV) tissue polarization. Third, it actually represents the A.I. rather than the apical constriction index. 2.2.4.4.1.1 Parameter definition To obtain a precise and biologically meaningful quantity for AC, first a couple of definitions had to be made. AC is independent of orientation and polarization Cells may be polarized along the AP axis Cells may also be polarized along the DV axis AC is independent of lateral height Lateral height can be described as the distance of the two farthest points on the surface area of a cell Two cells with different lateral heights can be equally apically constricted AC is independent of cell size The size of a cell is its volume Two cells of different volume can be equally apically constricted 2.2.4.4.1.2 Adaption for variation in lateral height To test different A.I. conditions, an apically constricted cell can be approximated by modeling a tetrahedron. For example, shrinking or enlarging a cell symmetrically should not affect the ACI. As described by Harding(2014)(58), the apical width of a cell is measured first by manual 3-D reconstruction, second manual re-orientation, and third by going 1 \\(\\mu\\)m from the apical tip into the cell (from now on referred to as \\(\\Delta\\)ap, 2.9B). Finally, apical width is the total width of the 2-D object in the respective Z-stack plane. If \\(\\Delta\\)ap is a constant, the A.I. in a symmetrically enlarged cell increases from e.g. ~15 to ~23, since apical width stays the same but lateral height increases. On the contrary, if \\(\\Delta\\)ap is adjusted relative to a cells lateral height, e.g. by percentage, the A.I. in a symmetrically enlarged cell stays the same (figure 2.9). Figure 2.9: A.I. model A-A A.I. Cell Models. A and A show cells that are symmetrically increased versions of A. While in A, constant delta was used, in A delta was adjusted relative to the lateral height. B Illustrating delta ap. (left) apically constricted cells volume rendered in XY (top) and as a lateral cross-section in X-Z (bottom). (right) 2D area as seen at delta ap of 1 or 2.5 \\(\\mu\\)m. Therefore the measurement for apical width has to be relative to lateral height. \\[\\mathbf{ACI} = \\frac{lateral\\;height\\;[\\mu m]}{relative\\;apical\\;width\\;[\\mu m]}\\] 2.2.4.4.1.3 Adaption for tissue polarization Organs develop in a 3-D space and are polarized along each axis. AC usually describes a 2-D morphogenetic movement towards a center along the X-Y axes. However, the contraction movements along X and Y might be independent of one another. This could mean that they happen at different speeds, or that one is absent. As a result, the tissue would look less radially (figure 2.10B) constricted, but more constricted along one particular axis (anisotropic). In order to separate those two AC dimensions, the A.I. can be calculated for the anterio-posterior and for the dorso-ventral axis (figure 2.10, horizontal vs. vertical). Figure 2.10: Schematic AC along the A-P and D-V axis. A shows a A-P and D-V constricted cluster of cells. B shows a D-V constricted cluster of cells. By fitting an ellipsoid to the volume area taken at \\(\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\)ap, one will obtain the following parameters (figure ??). Length of Major axis constituting apical width Length of Minor axis constituting apical height Angle of Major from 0\\(^\\circ\\) indicative for orientation of lateral height: If the angle is close to 0\\(^\\circ\\), the long axis of the apical area is parallel to the AP axis (the cell is constricted along the DV axis). If the angle is close to 90\\(^\\circ\\), the long axis of the apical area is parallel to the DV axis (the cell is constricted along the AP axis). (ref:ellipse) Scheme of ellipsoid measures. A shows the major axis as apical width and the minor axis as apical height. B shows the angular displacement from the horizon in steps of 30\\(^\\circ\\). The two dimensions of AC indices can therefore be described as the following ratios \\[\\mathbf{A.I._{Major}} = \\frac{lateral\\;height\\;[\\mu m]}{Major\\;axis\\;[\\mu m]}\\] \\[\\mathbf{A.I._{Minor}} = \\frac{lateral\\;height\\;[\\mu m]}{Minor\\;axis\\;[\\mu m]}\\] \\[\\mathbf{Angle_{Major}} = \\measuredangle = \\mathrm{\\Delta}\\;from\\;horizont\\;[0-90^\\circ]\\] 2.2.4.4.2 Measurements 2.2.4.4.2.1 Single Cell measurements Each geometric object has a centroid coordinate in X and Y (and Z) which is represented as the mean of all X or Y coordinates within the object. Here, the centroid coordinates in X and Y are used to plot the cells as points in the X-Y plane. Additionally, each point is colored for the A.I. value (high values are red - dark red, middle values are green, low values are cyan - blue). (ref:ACIMinor) A.C.I.~Major / Minor~ single cell measurements Figure 2.11: (ref:ACIMinor) Harding(2013)(58) were using a constant \\(\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\)ap to measure the apical width, which we have shown to be incorrect in certain cases. In their study they found that certain mean A.I. values in the DMSO go as high as 15, which might be related to this 2.9. By measuring apical width at a relative \\(\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\)ap and taking into account all pLLP cells these two exemplary pLLPs show a mean difference in the Major of 1.11 and 0.53 in the Minor (see table @ref(tab:aci_summary)). (ref:HardingACI) AI indices by Harding et al. E-G 3-D reconstructions of the highlighted cell. H A.I.s for embryos treated with DMSO, SU5402, PD0325901 or following induction of hsp70:dn-Ras. (n = 180 cells / N = 6 embryos). 2.2.4.4.2.2 Angle densities To check whether there is a bias in orientation of the apical width, the angle measurements ?? can be shown as a function of density along X. Here, a binwidth of 2.5 and a grouping factor to color the two conditions DMSO and SU5402 was used. Interestingly the results indicate that there is less of a difference for the MajorAngle at angles bigger than 15-20\\(^\\circ\\). This would mean that the apical width in SU5402 treated embryos is more strongly oriented along the horizontal antero-posterior axis. 2.2.4.4.2.3 ACI magnitude at different Angles Now, to get an idea of the magnitude ACIMajor and ACIMinor have at each angle, each can be shown as a function of the MajorAngle over ACI (while MajorAngle is the same for both ACIs). Again, the grouping factor GT was used to color the two conditions DMSO and SU5402. Since AC is a 3-D morphogenetic process and since cells in a wild type PLLp are mostly radially organized, it does make sense to try to look at AC from more than just one perspective. Here we propose to separate the ACI into an antero-posterior and a dorso-ventral dimension. Interestingly there does not seem to be much of a difference in ACIMinor, which can also be shown by the mean values which are at 2.6 for the DMSO control and at 2.1 for the SU5402 treated condition. This indicates that there is no significant difference in contraction along the dorso-ventral axis. For the ACIMajor the base constriction for both, DMSO and SU5402 is at around 3.6, however there is a peak at around 40-60° in the DMSO control where cells are most constricted having a maximum ACI at 15.8. This indicates that cells coming from 35.7° are most constricted in the anterior-posterior axis. Figure 2.12: ACIMajor / ACIMinor over MajorAngle 2.3 Ground Truth Analyzing images and extracting quantitative measurements can be a tedious task, especially when the analysis becomes more complex. Fortunately, there are ways to automate image analysis by using either machine learning approaches or by tailoring hand-crafted algorithms in an image analysis software tool like e.g. ImageJ(59). The main advantages of doing so are to be independent of confirmation bias make the analysis more robust against oversight increase the statistical power by increasing the number of data points(60) increase effect size by increasing the measurement accuracy(60) However, to ensure the measurements taken by a tailored or trained algorithm are meaningful, they must be compared to a ground truth dataset which again describes a general measure of algorithmic quality performance(61). 2.3.1 Cluster Analysis The anaLLzR2D algorithm was designed for semi-automatic cell cluster detection in the cldnb:lyn-gfp transgenic line and optional nuclei counting in a second DAPI labeled channel within the Regions of Interest (ROIs) derived from the cell cluster detection. 2.3.1.1 Design To assess the quality of the anaLLzR2D algorithm for nuclei detection the ground truth was designed as follows. 2.3.1.1.1 Model each Cell Cluster (CC) consists of a number of objects (cells) each object is part of the respective CC and defines one cell entity each object is determined via a fluorescent nucleus label embryos are mounted within a 3D mold (section 2.2.3.5) to reduce noise Table 2.17: Cluster Analysis Model XY scale 0.32 px/\\(\\mu\\)m Z-spacing 4 \\(\\mu\\)m Camera Rolera 2.3.1.1.2 Training &amp; test data The training set consists of three randomly picked wild type pLLPs. For each the algorithm was run with standard parameters. Cell cluster ROIs and nuclei multi-point labels were edited manually. To test the algorithm, it is run at different nuclei detection thresholds on the same image data. 2.3.2 Morphometric analysis The anallzr3D algorithm was designed for fully automated, single cell volume segmentation in the cldnb:lyn-gfp transgenic line. In addition to 3D cellular metrics, it offers Apical Constriction measurement of each cell. 2.3.2.1 Design To assess the quality of the anaLLzr3D algorithm the ground truth was modeled as follows. 2.3.2.1.1 Model each PLLp consists of a number of objects (cells) each object is part of the PLLp and defines one cell entity cell boundaries are determined via the transgene cldnb:lyn-gfp +/+ embryos are imaged live to conserve signal and membrane integrity embryos are mounted within a 3D mold for improved 3D alignment Table 2.18: anaLLzr3D Model Exposure time 100 ms Laser intensity 100\\(\\%\\) / 9.3 mW Objective 40X; CFI APO LWD WI; N.A. = 1.15, W.D. = 0.60 mm Z-spacing 0.4 - 0.5 \\(\\mu\\)m Camera sCMOS; 4.2 M.Pix; 82\\(\\%\\) Q.E.

For each the algorithm is run with no filters (X, Y, Z border objects, size) and a minimum segmentation threshold. Afterwards the segmentation result is corrected manually for over- and under-segmentation and objects that are not part of the PLLp. To test the algorithm it is run at different segmentation thresholds on the same image data. 2.4 Image Data Sets Summaries of Image datasets Table 2.19: Cell Cluster dataset Crossings Pairs 4 Transgenes cldnb:lyn-gfp +/?

This process allows to mount eight to ten embryos per dish. To take advantage of the high number of offspring a single zebrafish female may lay, a new sample preparation technique was designed that allows for (1) a four to five times increase in samples per dish (2) a facilitated navigation via a grid-like orientation through the samples and (3) an improved spatial orientation where the embryos body axes are aligned parallel to the optical Z-sections of the confocal microscope. For details, see Materials and Methods section 2.2.3.5. 3.1.2 anaLLzr2D - CC segmentation 3.1.2.1 Image Analysis A custom IJ macro script was developed (section 2.2.4.1.1) that segments individual cell clusters and the pLLP. Using ROIs as masks, the nuclei within counted with a 2-D maxima finder. To detect the right amount of nuclei however, it is necessary to evaluate the distance over which the blurring should be applied. A typical nucleus in the PLLp is about 5 \\(\\mu\\)m in diameter. To determine the right blurring value, a range of 4-6 \\(\\mu\\)m in steps of 0.5 is tested. Figure 3.1 shows a registered maximum Z projected lateral line used for ground truth evaluation. Figure 3.1: Registration of 2D data. Cluster Segments Registered, MaxIP data with cell cluster segments of the lyn-GFP signal laid upon the DAPI signal. Cell Labels Magenta dots represent the maxima found within each ROI and hence the nuclei labels. 3.1.2.2 Data Analysis Comparing the segmented objects count of the Gaussian parameters with the Ground Truth gives an indication for over- resp. under-segmentation. In figure 3.2 the relative numbers for each blurring parameter can be seen in percentage above or below the mean cell count of the ground truth (blue horizon). The red area represents over-segmentation, the green under-segmentation. Figure 3.2: Relative difference of segment counts To estimate the quality of nuclei detection for each parameter, the ratio of automatically detected and ground truth objects count can be calculated and compared (table 3.1). The closer it is to 1, the better. Table 3.1: Nuclei count ratio NB45 NB50 NB55 NB60 NB70 Mean_ratio 1.30 1.14 1.04 0.95 0.86 STD. 0.23 0.17 0.15 0.14 0.14 In summary, maximum performance is achieved at a scaled parameter of 6 \\(\\mu\\)m, with a ratio of of 0.95 for the count objects and a standard deviation of 0.14. 3.1.3 anaLLzr3D - pLLP segmentation 3.1.3.1 Image Analysis A custom IJ macro script was developed (section 2.2.4.1.3) that recognizes cell boundaries via the fluorescence signal emitted by a Lyn Kinase tethered eGFP which expression is controlled by the cxcr4b lateral line specific promotor (26). The central IJ tool used to do this is the MorphoLibJs(62) Morpholigical Segmentation plugin. The plugin however requires to choose for a segmentation threshold that determines the quality and the quantity of segmented objects. This parameter therefore plays an essential role in the reliability of the analysis results. 3.1.3.1.1 Registration The first module of the macro is PLLp registration in X, Y and cropping in Z. This is accomplished by an initial maximum Z projection and blurring of the image, 2D segmentation using a minimum threshold and lastly by rotating the segment through the angle formed by the long axis of the ellipsoid and the horizon (at 0\\(^{\\circ}\\)). After rotation the image is cropped according to the obtained ROI. Additionally, the centers of the most constricting areas are detected via an intensity based dynamic threshold and highlighted as magenta circles in 3.3.

Figure 3.4: cldnb:lyn-gfp fluorescence signal in a cross-section of the pLLP (Obj.: 40X APO) To compare the results between the Ground Truth segments and the segments obtained from different threshold levels graphically, for a single pLLP the Ground Truth and threshold level are shown as a composite color image in figure 3.5. By using a green lookup-table (LUT) for the ground truth and a magenta LUT for the threshold level[n], one can readily detect overlapping objects (white), over segmentation (magenta) and under segmentation (green).

Volume renderings have been done with IJs VolumeViewer 3.1.3.2 Data Analysis 3.1.3.2.1 Cell Count In figure 3.6 the relative numbers for each threshold level can be seen in percentage above or below the mean cell count of the ground truth (blue horizon). Analogous to the graphical inspection, the magenta area represents over segmentation, the green under segmentation. Additionally, table ?? shows the absolute numbers.

The results show a strong significant difference between DMSO und SU5402 treated embryos in both ACIMajor and ACIMinor, validating the general concept. Figure 3.7: A.C.I. proof of concept. A and B Each dot represents the average of all cells of a whole pLLP (DMSO = 1769 cells / 13 pLLPs; SU5402 = 2066 cells / 15 pLLPs). 3.1.3.2.3 Cell Morphology There is always a precision / recall trade-off in detection tasks, e.g., when we set a lower threshold [. . .], we can get a higher recall with a lower precision ([. . .], but meanwhile we also get more false-positives in the results).(45) Inspecting the cell count unfortunately does not directly tell us how well the cell morphology is conserved at different threshold levels, since at higher threshold levels the cell boundaries are differently determined and eventually not even recognized as such anymore. The volume of a cell is a very robust morphological feature. Therefore, if its volume does not differ significantly at a given threshold level we consider its morphology to be conserved. In figure 3.8 the distribution and amount of the cell volumes across the different threshold levels can be inspected via the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF). The closer the slopes are to the ground truth, the stronger they are conserved. The upper graph of figure 3.8 shows the full distribution, where the major differences seem to appear within the 0.4 quantile (red line). Therefore, the lower graph of figure 3.8 only the values within the 0.4 quantile are shown to get a more detailed impression. Figure 3.8: upper Cell volumes full distribution (red line = .4 Quantile) lower Cell volumes distribution within .4 Quantile 3.1.3.2.4 Confidence Level To statistically check how closely related each threshold level sample distribution is compared to the ground truth, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Test (ks.test) was performed. The ks.test is a nonparametric test whose null hypothesis is that the both groups compared were sampled from populations with identical populations. Therefore, the closer the p-value is to 1, the more similar the tested sample distribution would be to the Ground Truth (figure 3.9). \\[H_{0} : F_X(x)=F_0(x)\\] Figure 3.9: Volumetric conservation (red line = 5\\(\\%\\) confidence threshold) In comparison to the Mann-Whitney test, the ks.test is more sensitive to detect changes in the shape of the distribution than to detect a shift of the median(63) 3.2 Shroom3 3.2.1 Phenotype description While birth rates follow a distribution of Mendelian inheritance (after genotyping at 3 months of age), mutant adults seem to be more sensitive to mechanical stress and have a shortened lifespan (~6-9 months). In body shape, shroom3 mutants are not smaller or posses any other striking phenotype (figure 3.10C), however their gill flaps seem to be increased in size, swollen, and not exactly streamlined with the body. This is also evident by an increased frequency of gill flap beating. When looking at the pLLP at different stages (figure 3.10D), they exhibit the same phenotype as the MO injected embryos. Figure 3.10: shroom3 mutant phenotype (A-A) mutation strategy (A) Talen arms (black blocks) bordering a sequence within SD1 including a restriction site for NsiI (indicated back arrows and grey background) (A) wildtype and mutant allele with 8 bp deletion (B-B) Amino acid code and protein schematic with functional domains and stop codon (indicated by asterisk) (C-C) Adult phenotype with closeup to gill flaps (D) pLLP phenotype for three different stages (columns) and different manifestations (rows) (40X WI objective).

When incrossed, genotyping of two to five days post fertilization (dpf) embryos results in a Mendelian distribution. However, for stock-fish that are regenerated and genotyped by finclip at about 3 months of age show only a rate of 5-10\\(\\%\\) of shroom3--. After another 3  6 months those would usually decease too. Therefore, defect Shroom3 in D.rerio leads to increased mortality. 3.2.2 Lateral Line Morphometrics Since in the previous study performed on shroom3 morphants we found a significantly reduced number of rosettes in the pLLP, a reduced number of CCs was expected to be deposited at the end of pLLP migration as well. Instead we found more CCs deposited 3.10E. 3.2.2.1 Dataset To analyze this observation quantitatively a dataset was put together consisting of ~100 zebrafish embryos fixed at the end of pLLP migration, derived from four different parent pairs. After genotyping, this gave us 33 wildtypes, 66 heterozygous and 33 homozygous mutants for statistical tests. In addition to the number and position of deposited NMs, we also measured the area and the number of nuclei in each deposited CC. 3.2.2.2 Number and Position of Cell Clusters Although the embryos were closely staged ($$20 min.), there are always some individual variations in the distance migrated by the pLLP of each. To compare the number of deposited CCs independently of LL length the ratio of LL length over CC count (3.11B) was calculated. Fixation with PFA may introduce a slight bending of the embryo and mounting introduces a different tilt for each embryo, to correct for uneven LL paths and irregularities in mounting, CC distances are calculated in Euclidean space rather than solely in dimension X. While shrm3++ embryos deposit 6 \\(\\pm\\) 0.7 CCs, shroom3-- embryos deposit 8 \\(\\pm\\) 0.9 CCs (3.11A). This difference stays true also when normalizing against length (3.11B). Figure 3.11: Cluster counts. A cluster count [\\(n\\)] B normalized to length (LL length [\\(mm\\)] / cluster count [\\(n\\)]) Even though CC position in individual shroom3-- embryos seems more random, the position of the first deposited CC is mostly conserved (3.12A), \\(p\\) for difference in position = 0.2). Similarly, the position of the pLLP also isnt significantly changed confirming that Shroom3 activity is not required for migration, as was already shown in shroom3 morphants (44). While for the remaining CCs an average lag of -50.4 \\(\\mu\\)m as compared to shroom3++ CC positions is observed, it also seems to increase with later CC positions. For shroom3++ embryos CC position is mostly conserved through development, however it remains elusive if this is true for shroom3-- embryos too. Figure 3.12A, shows the kernel density distribution for the CC position without grouping individual positions. At a binwidth of 50 \\(\\mu\\)m, the distribution curves show a high and narrow density at around 350 \\(\\mu\\)m, which is the average location of CC1 (3.12 2A). For the remaining CCs the kernel distribution does, neither for shroom3++ nor for shroom3-- embryos, reveal a precise location. In contrast, if based on CC sequential identity the mean position and standard deviation is calculated, a more explicit pattern emerges which clearly shows the increased count and average frequency (3.12 2A). This shows that in the absence of Shroom3 activity, more NMs form. This is particularly surprising since the lad had previously shown that shroom3 knock-down leads to a defect in rosette formation and these rosettes prefigure the deposited NM.

In order to determine whether these additional clusters are comprised of as many cells as their wild-type counterparts or less, I quantified the number of cells and the size of each clusters in shroom3-- embryos, the cell count per CC was determined by counting DAPI stained cells within CC segments derived from the cldnb:lyn-gfp membrane signal (section 2.3). Both cells per CC and area per CC are shrunk by about 6% in shroom3-- embryos, while the density of cells per area remains unchanged (3.13A). Interestingly, when comparing not individual CC cell counts but cell counts per embryo an increase of 9% is observed (3.13B). Both the sum of CC cells and total LL cells (CC+pLLP) are significantly increased in shroom3-- embryos, while the count of only pLLP cells remains unchanged. Figure 3.13: LL Morphometrics A individual CC statistics B Sums per embryo. (Bars = median, errorbars = 95% CI) 3.2.2.4 Thermodynamic Rescue Increasing temperature usually leads to an acceleration in thermodynamics and embryonic development, while lower temperatures slow down development (64). Slowing down development also leads to a reduction in speed of migration and therefore to a reduction in forces that act on cells, cell-cell junctions and organ structures. For this experiment the hypothesis to test was that it should be possible to at least partially restore the shroom3++ number of CCs by giving rosettes a longer time to develop properly. Since embryos develop at different speeds, it is more challenging to exactly stage match them at end of migration. To account for this the CC count was normalized to LL length. Figure 3.14: Thermodynamic rescue A LL lengths and end of migration stage matching B groupwise comparison of the length normalized CC count per temperature. The question was if we could restore wildtype CC counts in shroom3-- embryos when incubating at lower temperatures. Therefore, we need to compare CC counts between T25-- and T30++ resp. p-values between the pairs T30-- vs for T30++ (the original) and T25-- vs T30++ (the actual hypothesis). Even though the CC count T25-- cannot be completely restored (~3.2 to ~2.8 in median normalized CC count), the difference between tested pairs shrunk from 0.00000 (T30-- vs for T30++) to 0.00210 (T25-- vs T30++), which is much closer to a rejection of \\(H_0\\). At this point, the question remains open but seems probable that at even lower temperatures the wildtype CC count could be rescues in shroom3-- embryos.

Rescuing the CC count by slowing down embryonic development was only partially successful, but seems probable at even lower temperatures. For the pLLP at end of migration however, the number of cells is unaffected - which raises the question if Shroom3 has a regulatory role in Proliferation. 3.2.3 Proliferation LL morphometric analysis revealed that deposited CCs in shroom3-- embryos were on average slightly smaller and had fewer cells incorporated. However, due to the additional two cell clusters deposited, the net count is ~9\\(\\%\\) increased at the end of migration. To test whether this is due to higher proliferative activity a dataset of time-lapse movies (12 h / \\(\\Delta\\)T = 6 min.) was generated to count the number of mitoses in a cxcr4b(BAC):H2BRFP transgenic background similar to previous proliferation studies in the pLLP (28, 65). 3.2.3.1 Datasets The live imaging dataset consists of 12 shrm3++ and 18 shrm3-- embryos with about 75 timepoints for each pLLP and 150 the cell clusters. For counting, tracks were created for each proliferative cell on MaxIPs (section 2.2.4.3). Figure 3.15A shows a shroom3++ and a shroom3-- LL after 12 h of imaging where each mitotic track is individually colored and overlaid to the image data. To support and validate this data two more datasets from fixed embryos were generated, one with a EdU (N = 3, n++ = 26, n-- = 17) and one with a phospho-Histone marker (N = 3, n++ = 22, n-- = 29). 3.2.3.2 Lateral Line Mitoses Tracking mitoses in the pLLP does not reveal any difference in proliferation from start (~28 hpf) till about mid of migration 12 hours later (3.15B). For confirmation, this finding was also validated via two more additional methods. During the cell cycle genetic material is replicated in S-phase, while in metaphase of mitosis histones are found to be heavily phosphorylated (66). With an 5-Ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay (67), cells in S-phase can be detected (3.15B). Using a specific phospho-Histone (p-Hist.) antibody cells in meta-phase can be detected. When comparing the EdU index (EdU positive cells over total pLLP cell number) or the mitotic index (p-Hist. positive cells over total pLLP cell number) I could confirm that there is no difference in proliferation in the migrating pLLP. Still, at end of migration the LL system in shroom3-- embryos does incorporate 9\\(\\%\\) more cells (figure 3.13). Figure 3.15: pLLP proliferation A Tracks of Mitosis.

B and C, the colored bar indicated the median, bars indicate the 95% CI. Since individual shroom3-- CCs are smaller, we wondered if there could be compensation mechanisms activated that increases proliferation to restore wildtype CC size once they are deposited. To verify this, CC mitoses were tracked on the same data as before. Other than the pLLP, which can be observed throughout the time-lapse, CCs only begin to exist when they are deposited. To normalize for individual CC lifetimes, the number of mitoses per CC is divided by the duration of the total time-lapse minus the time span to when it first appeared. \\(\\frac{mitoses\\ per\\ CC\\ [n]}{total\\ time- time\\ of\\ deposition\\ [T]}\\) This clearly shows that the additional cells in shroom3-- embryos are derived from CC proliferation, rather than pLLP proliferation (3.15C). 3.2.3.3 Summary These results show that the additional cells at end of migration observed in the LL analysis do not stem from an increase in proliferation in the pLLP, but instead from increased proliferation after CCs are deposited. 3.2.4 Rosette Formation and Cluster Deposition Having shown that the additional CC deposition in shroom3-- embryos is not caused by an over-proliferation in the migrating pLLP, the next step was to have a closer look at the dynamics of rosette formation, in relation to pLLP morphometrics and CC deposition. To test dependencies between different observations and developmental dynamics, variables can be correlated. To do this and to have a coherent dataset to work with, the data of three different analyses on a single set of image data were joined. First, to get to know the exact timing of CC deposition, a manual tracking tool (55) was used (figure 3.16, tracking). Second, to deduce pLLP morphometrics an IJ macro was developed (anaLLzr2DT, section 2.2.4.1.2) for spatiotemporal registration of the pLLP and to yield information about its speed, area, roundness, etc. (3.16, Registration). Third, to detect rosettes and quantify their weights, a CNN (68) was used on the registered pLLP output from the before mentioned IJ macro (section 2.2.4.2; figure 3.16 - Detection). Finally, all three datasets were joined by embryo id and timepoint. 3.2.4.1 Dataset The image data set analyzed consists of 20 time-lapse movies (11 shroom3--, 9 shroom3++). Each time-lapse has a duration of ~20 h (~8 min. interval)19, summing up to ~1650 shroom3--, and ~1350 shroom3++ timepoints. Figure 3.16: Rosette Formation Joined Datasets. Tracking pLLP is marked as no.1. The rest of the CCs is numbered sequentially as they appear. Registration The black outline marks the region of interest (ROI) that is the pLLP as it is detected by the anaLLzr2DT. The red line highlights the pLLPs leading edge. Detection Each square highlights a detected rosette by the CNN, colors represent rosette weights. 3.2.4.2 Cluster Deposition Figure 3.17A shows a montage of a shroom3++ and a shroom3-- scenario in cluster deposition (3.5 h / ~20 min. interval). For shroom3++ the rosette structure seems tight and two depositions occur in a regular manner. In the shroom3-- on the other hand, rosette structure are more fragile with less pronounced rosette centers and four observed depositions. Interestingly, based on the cldnb:lyn-gfp signal the area of constriction seems to be less radially organized but more oriented towards the horizontal midline. Furthermore, the trailing rosettes are significantly smaller and do not seem to separate as clean from the migrating primordium. In addition, for L3 it first seems like two CCs could be deposited, until they merge again to a single CC about 1.5 h later. Figure 3.17: Cluster Deposition. A shroom3++ and shroom3-- LL development in comparison. L1 - L4 are deposited CCs. Arrows indicate deposition events. Dotted lines are tracks of rosette to CC transition. B Statistics of deposited cluster counts C Change of CC position through time. Each line represents the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) of all CCn positions observed. On average, as it was shown in section 3.2.2.2, theres a significant increase in clusters deposited (3.17B). Also, neither shroom3++ nor shroom3-- CCs drastically change their position once they are deposited. 3.2.4.3 Registration As the pLLP migrates it moves through space and time. To measure velocity and acceleration, one needs to detect where in space (the image in X and Y) the pLLP is located at multiple timepoints. When duplicating the pLLP based on a detection ROI from the whole image, the pLLP is registered in time and space (figure 3.18A). As shown in figure 3.18B-B neither speed nor acceleration drastically differ throughout the complete course of migration. Speed drops from an initial ~75 \\(\\mu\\)m/h to about ~30 \\(\\mu\\)m/h for both shroom3++ and shroom3-- 17 h later (figure 3.3 A). Similarly, while there is a positive acceleration of almost ~2 \\(\\mu\\)m/h peaking after ~2-3 hours, the remaining two peaks progressively get smaller (3.18A). While for the area no difference can be detected (3.18C), interestingly the roundness is on average significantly reduced in shroom3-- pLLPs (3.18D). This is also evident from the montage in figure 3.17A. Figure 3.18: pLLP time-resolved morphometrics. A Registration procedure B-B Leading edge (l.e.) speed and acceleration in \\(\\mu\\)m/h, displayed as LOESS curves with at a span of 0.5 C Area in square \\(\\mu\\)m and D Roundness displayed as mean±se (standard error). 3.2.4.4 Rosette Detection To quantify the maturity of rosettes within the pLLP a CNN was used which allows to detect objects within images (Region Proposal based CNN). Inherent to object detection and classification by a neural network is that the network not only tells us if an object was detected (of numbers room \\(\\mathbb{N_0}\\)), but also how secure it is - the probability - that the object detected is the right one (of numbers room \\(x\\in[0, 1]\\subset\\mathbb{R}\\)) - the weighted detection. Furthermore, the weighted detection was capped a score \\(\\leq\\) 0.5, since below 0.5 the probability would be to insecure. In our case the network was trained to detect wildtype rosettes, while also presenting pLLPs of embryos treated with a compound that inhibits rosette formation (SU5402) to refine learning. Therefore, if the network detected 1 rosette with a probability of 0.99, it is very likely that this is a wildtype rosette. However, at different developmental stages and genetic background (e.g. mutants with impaired rosette formation) the pLLP exhibits a different count of rosettes. Therefore it would be wrong to compare just the sum of detections or weighted detections per pLLP, but it is necessary to normalize for the different count of rosettes to get a global figure of pLLP rosettization - the rosettiness. \\[\\textbf{Rosettiness} = \\frac{\\sum_{} \\textrm{Weighted Detections}}{\\sum_{} \\textrm{Detections}} = \\textrm{Normalized Weight}\\] Figure 3.19: Quantification of rosettes. A Model of detection and weighted detection in shroom3++ and shroom3-- embryos B Actual detection in pLLPs of shroom3++ and shroom3-- embryos at six different timepoints and highlighted detection weight. The kymographs20 in figure 3.20A-A were generated from pLLPs that were previously registered with the anaLLzr2DT IJ macro (section (mat-anallzr2dt)). After registration, a line was drawn along the horizontal midline (3.18A). Finally, recorded kymographs were turned to false color (blue = low intensity, red = high intensity) for better visual interpretation. In shroom3++ the higher intensities are highly concentrated to two to three distinct regions within the migrating pLLP, while in the shroom3-- pLLP the higher intensities are more fragmented and overall reduced. To analyze this statistically, all pLLPs were quantified in terms of rosette count and average rosette weight or rosettiness (section 2.2.4.2). The numbers reveal two very interesting things. First, the medians show that rosette count (3.18B) is only reduced for the first six hours, while rosettiness is reduced almost throughout the entire 20 hours. Second, while for rosette counts two to six indeed half or more of the pLLPs are shroom3++, for counts below two and above six there are more shroom3-- pLLPs (3.18B). Furthermore figure @(fig:rdtdet)C shows that at a rosettiness of ~0.7 there are about as many shroom3++ as there are shroom3-- pLLPs, marking this point as a threshold were pLLPs above are more like likely to be shroom3++ and below more likely to be shroom3--. At ~0.1 rosettiness there are almost only shroom3-- pLLPs, while at ~0.9 rosettiness there are almost only shroom3++ pLLPs. In addition, the data distributions attached to the sides (3.18B and C) reveal that for the rosettiness the KDE did not actually shift to a lower number, but rather flattened and variance is increased.

In this section my goal was to collect detailed information about LL morphometrics and rosette formation to find out what is causing the additional CCs to be deposited. To do this I combined the results of three different analyses to be able to detect inter-dependencies between variables. For my questioning the most interesting variable to find dependencies with is rosettiness. As mentioned in section 3.2.1 when we had a first closer look at the pLLP phenotype we found that many of the clearly as shroom3-- identified embyros still were reminiscent of the shroom3++ phenotype. However, what surprised us the most (due to to previous results indicating an important role during rosette assembly for Shroom3), was that a fraction had significantly more CCs deposited. To test the interdependence between rosettiness and CCs deposited quantitatively we set up two hypotheses. First, when we had a closer look at timelapse movies of the migrating pLLP at a high temporal resolution we had the impression that while in shroom3++ embryos the pLLP stalled for a moment during CC deposition, this was not the case in shroom3-- embryos. Therefore the hypothesis to test (figure 3.21A) was that higher speeds lead to a lower degree of rosettiness and vice versa. Unfortunately the correlation coefficient and model indicate a rather low interdependence. However, both shroom3++ and shroom3-- also showed a high timely dependence in rosettiness and acceleration (3.20C and 3.18B). Second, since we know Shroom3 plays a role in rosette assembly and that embryos deficient for Shroom3 have on average more CCs deposited, we wanted to test if there is a direct link between the two and have statistical certainty. Therefore, the hypothesis to test for figure 3.21B was if lower rosettiness leads to a higher number of CCs deposited and vice versa. Since here the end of migration cluster count is one-dimensional (one number per embryo), we had to correlate it to a per embryos summary statistic rosettiness. Here the correlation coefficient is rather high, the interdependence seems to be true. Additionally, the clusters determined are nicely separated from each other and the shroom3++ and shroom3-- pLLPs seem to form two independent groups. Figure 3.21: Developmental interdependencies. A Pearson correlation coefficient between rosettiness and speed of migration through time B Single dots in the scatterplots in represent the variables scatter in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the red line shows a linear model through the point cloud, red digits indicate the correlation coefficient. Black spots with grey circles indicate the centers for clusters calculated on these two sets of data. Clustering was performed hierarchical. 3.2.4.6 Shroom3 Rescue To find out if the phenotype of increased CCs deposited can be rescued by ectopic expression of Shroom3, a transgene was used where shroom3v1 is fused to RFP and expressed under control of heatshock promotor (HSP70). While this construct was used to rescue rosette number in Shroom3 morphants before (44) (section 1.2.4.1), here it was used to test if CC count and rosettiness can be restored. Furthermore, by rescuing the shroom3-- phenotype with Shroom3 itself it is possible to control for LL unspecific effects introduced by the mutation that might have happened earlier in development. To do a comparable analysis like in the inter-dependencies analysis, embryos were imaged two times. First at around 36 hpf, and a second time at end of migration after about 24 hours of incubation at 28.5\\(^\\circ\\). This way it is possible to test for correlations between rosettiness earlier in development and CC count at end of migration. Unlike in the first experiment, here rosettiness is not the median of multiple timepoints, but the measurement from a single timepoint. However, as shown in figure 3.20, rosettiness is most affected at the beginning of migration. Furthermore, I had difficulties identifying embryos carrying the transgene by PCR, which is why they were partially identified visually via expression od RFP. In addition shroom++ and shroom+- embyos were pooled to increase statistical power. Figure 3.22: shroom3 ectopic expression.

For the rosettiness however, we still get a significant difference (3.22B). Correlation between CC count and rosettiness (figure 3.22C) for heat-shocked embryos without hs:shr3v1 transgene (_hs:shr3v1_00, left panel) is about the same as for embryos non heat-shocked (hs:shr3v1??, second panel from right), but inverse to heat-shocked embryos with transgene (hs:shr3v1 +?, second panel from left). Importantly, correlation is lost between heat-shocked shroom3-- embryos with transgene and non heat-shocked shroom3+? embryos (right panel). Table 3 summarizes the number of datapoints. 3.2.4.7 Mechanic Rescue It is very well known that Rho kinases are necessary for mechanic force transmission in various developmental processes (14, 37, 42, 69, 70). Since Rock is also thought to be a key player of the Shroom force mediation pathway in the pLLP, the idea for a mechanic rescue was to titrate different concentrations of a Rock inhibitor (Rockout, section 2.1.1) and a non-muscle myosin II (NMII) activator (Calyculin, section 2.1.1) to see if this way can confirm the correlation between rosettiness and CC number in an independent manner. 3.2.4.7.1 Rock inhibition Rock2a, upon interaction with Shroom3, phosphorylates NMII which is necessary for contraction of the actin network and apical constriction (section @ref{intro-shroom}). Here we wanted to mimic the shroom3-- phenotype in shroom3++ embryos. Embryos were incubated at distinct (figure 3.23 legend) concentrations from 24 hpf till end of migration (about 60 hpf). At this stage embryos incubated at higher concentrations displayed a significant reduction in overall body length (3.23A). Therefore, to see if there is a specific effect on length, LL length was normalized to body length. Figure 3.23: Titration of Rock inhibitor. A LL lengths are reduced with increased concentrations of Rock inhibitor and B groupwise comparison of the length normalized cluster count per concentration of Fgf inhibitor. Rockout treatment at 10 \\(\\mu\\)M does not lead to a significant reduction in LL length but does significantly increase the number of CCs deposited, confirming the current hypothesis that Shroom3 acts though Rock.

The idea for this experiment was to rescue the shroom3-- phenotype by over-activation of NMII. Unfortunately, even when incubation at 100 nM (the maximum solubility), no significant differences can be detected. Figure 3.24: Calyculin treatment. A LL lengths and B groupwise comparison of the length normalized cluster count. Table 3.8: Calyculin rescue dataset summary genotype conc. (nM) LLs genotype conc. (nM) LLs ++ 0 8 -- 0 8 100 12 100 12 Note: concentrations in 0.1% DMSO 3.2.4.8 Summary I could (1) reproduce the results of more deposited CCs on live data as well, gaining more insight in the deposition process which shows smaller and more fragmented CCs and a more chaotic deposition process overall (2) show that neither speed nor acceleration are significantly different. Also the area of the pLLP is not affected, but roundness, confirming our impression that the pLLP in shroom3-- embryos is more elongated (3) show that while the integer number of rosettes in the pLLP is only significantly increased during the first 6-8 hours of migration, the overall rosettiness (rosette integrity per PLLP) is significantly reduced over the whole path of migration. Rosettiness is strongly correlated to the final number of CCs deposited (3.21B) which is also evidenced by rescue of correlation between rosettiness at the beginning of migration and CC count at the end of migration (3.22C), concluding that rosettiness is the key parameter for the future outcome of CC pattern. Still, the question is what determines rosette weight. Although acceleration and rosettiness are correlated only weakly, they are significantly stronger correlated in shroom3-- than they are in shroom3++ embryos throughout time (3.21A). This finding is also confirmed by an experiment where the CC count of shroom3-- can be rescued when incubated at lower temperature (section 3.2.2.4). In conclusion these results lead to the conclusion that shroom3-- rosettes are destabilized with increasing thermodynamics. Finally and importantly I found a high correlation between CCs deposited at end of migration and the median rosettiness throughout pLLP migration, which clearly demonstrates a direct link between rosette integrity and numbers of CCs deposited. Interestingly however not as previously, and intuitively, assumed. Here, Shroom3 is important not to strengthen rosette integrity in order to have CCs of the right size deposited. 3.2.5 Apical Constriction In the previous analysis I have shown a direct relationship between rosette integrity and CCs deposited, where lower rosette integrity leads to a fragmented rosettes and therefore to an increase in CC deposition frequency. To preserve rosette integrity and for proper CC maturation cells need to apically constrict. To gain further insight into Shroom3s contribution to apical constriction, it is appropriate to have a closer look at rosette conformation on a cellular scale. To do so, first a set of high spatial resolution, volumetric image data was generated (XY = 0.164 \\(\\mu\\)m / pixel; Z = 0.4 \\(\\mu\\)m) that allowed for a more rigorous inspection of morphological differences, and automated and unbiased single cell 3D reconstruction (2.2.4.4.2.1) using a newly developed IJ macro (section 2.2.4.1.3). Secondly, to investigate the contribution of various single cell morphometrics to rosette formation an app was developed21 that allows for a convenient handling of large amounts of retrieved data. (#fig:acdata,)High resolution, volumetric image data. Upper row shows the fluorescence signal at the membranes. Lower row shows the 3D reconstructed cells. Columns show the same pLLP from different angles. Inhibition of FGFR1 via drug treatment22 results in a concentration dependent loss of morphogenesis and rosette assembly in the pLLP (17, 32, 57). As a proof of principle and to validate previous studies, data of drug treated embryos (20 \\(\\mu\\)M) and appropriate DMSO (0.1\\(\\%\\) DMSO / E323) controls were included. 3.2.5.1 Dataset The dataset generated consists of three pLLP stages (3.25), four groups (DMSO, SU5402, shrm3++ and shroom3--), 267 pLLPs and 33.163 single cells.

For shroom3++ pLLPs two (3.26A, 32 hpf) to four (3.26A, 40 hpf) areas of constricting regions can be observed (XZ pane), in shroom3-- its three (3.26A, 36 hpf) to seven (3.26A, 40 hpf), confirming the results of rosette detection (3.2.4.4). While at 32 and 36 hpf the spread of those regions (indicated by bars in 3.26, XZ panes) is wider in shroom3--, at 40 hpf they are smaller but also increased in number. When looking at the central rosette along the width ((indicated by arrows in 3.26), YZ panes), it seems like there is no considerable difference between shroom3++ and shroom3-- rosettes. In SU5402 treated embryos, neither in XZ nor in YZ constriction can be observed and the cells seem to be mostly columnar in shape. In addition, while constriction seems isotropic in the shroom3++ rosette center, constriction in the shroom3-- rosette center cells appears an-isotropic. Figure 3.26: Apical Constriction in 3D. Stages are in columns, the groups are in rows. Each panel shows a MaxIP (top left), and orthogonal views along the length (XZ, bottom left) and the width (YZ, right). Arrow annotations in YZ panels indicate points of constriction. Bar annotations in XZ indicate the spread of region of constriction. 3.2.5.3 Single Cell Metrics To quantify AC in width and length and to gain a more objective view on cell geometry, apical constriction and other metrics such as height were quantified .To get a hold on AC an-isotropy we measured the length of the minor and major axis of a fit ellipsoid (as described in section (ACI-pol) and illustrated in figure 3.27A). If AC was an-isotropic and more cells are oriented towards the horizontal midline instead of being radially oriented, this could be shown by degrees of divergence (degrees \\(\\measuredangle\\)) from the horizontal midline (3.27A). For angle measurements, all angles are normalized to a 90\\(^\\circ\\) range, where 0\\(^\\circ\\) is along the horizontal midline. When comparing the ratio of cells in intervals of 15\\(^\\circ\\) along a range of 90\\(^\\circ\\) it can be shown that there are more shroom3-- than shroom3++ cells within the 0-15\\(^\\circ\\) interval through all three stages (3.25). Even more, it shows that there are more shroom3++ than shroom3-- cells within the remaining intervals  confirming the model of constriction an-isotropy. While reduction in ACI is stronger than the ACI in shroom3-- cells (3.27C-C), both are significantly reduced throughout time  again confirming the increase in constriction an-isotropy. For all three timepoints the ACI for SU5402 treated embryos is not only the smallest, but also stays at the same level (~2 in the ACI, ~3.4 in the ACI), therefore it can be seen as a lower threshold. Interestingly, the ACIs for DMSO, shroom3++ and shroom3-- are progressively converging this threshold from earlier to later stages. Figure 3.27: Apical Constriction metrics. A-A Measurements.

Errorbars indicate 95% CI. 3.2.5.4 Summary Here I could show that while AC is generally impaired in shroom3-- embryos, there is an an-isotropy where the reduction in AC is stronger in the 3.2.6 Haircell Specification In the analyses presented so far I have shown that embryos deficient for Shroom3 deposit more CCs, that this is caused by a fragmentation of rosettes (not by overproliferation) and that AC, which is important for CC maturation, is only partially diminished (more in A-P than in D-V axis). As described in section 1.1.2, a cells shape has direct impact on its ability to perceive and react to external cues. Here we were interested if the reduction in AC (change in cell shape, section 2.2.4.4.1.3) and overall smaller CCs (but not change in density, section 3.2.2.3) , two mechanical features, had an impact on HC specification and therefore if the LLs function as a sensory system would still be intact. Atoh1a (section 1.2.3.2, a TF that gives cells the potential to become sensory HCs), in the pLLP is locally expressed between leader and follower cells and is finally restricted to a single center cell via lateral inhibition (section 1.1.3.3). Since till today it was not shown why the center cell becomes the HC - here we wanted our hypothesis was that rosette assembly (radial organization) resp. AC could play a role. First, to check if atoh1a was still expressed in shroom3-- cells and if there were further implications in feedback loops with Notch signaling, an In Situ Hybridization (ISH, section 2.2.3.3) experiment was conducted (probes in section 2.1.8). For 36 and 40 hpf the count of atoh1a and deltaD expressing cells (3.28) seemed to be increased. Furthermore, especially at 40 hpf, the signal seems to be a lot more fragmented and fuzzier. Figure 3.28: Expression of deltaD and atoh1a in the pLLP. Recorded in greyscale at brightfield at 20X Magnification. Images show background subtracted and de-noised EDFs of original Z-stack data. Traditional ISH allows for detection of RNA transcripts on a whole embryo scale via a hybridizing anti-sense probe. However, since embryos are fixed, it only allows to analyze single time points. Furthermore, since images are taken in brightfield, quantification of signal intensity is difficult. To get access to developmental dynamics we made use of an additional, besides cldnb:lyn-gfp, transgenic construct where tdTomato24 (71) is expressed under direct control of the atoh1a promotor. By simultaneous observation of both fluorophores in a time-lapse setup (3.29B), the strategy was to follow up the dynamics of tdTomato to quantify the expression of atoh1a in cell count and intensity of expression. 3.2.6.1 Dataset For each group, shroom3++ and shroom3--, and timepoint the dataset was split into pLLP and CC (table 3.10). Each time-lapse has a duration of 18-20 hours, consists of about 54 timepoints and two channels (488 &amp; 561 nm). Table 3.10: Hair-cell specification dataset summary id labels metrics genotype sub-structure embryos timepoints per 3h shroom3++ pLLP 28 1566 261 CC 28 2499 shroom3-- pLLP 21 1134 189 CC 21 3566 3.2.6.2 Atoh1a in the LL While in both shroom3++ and shroom3-- tdTomato signal intensities are rising as soon as CCs are deposited (figure 3.29A), in shroom3-- pLLPs intensities are on the rise already in the first four hours of migration. Comparing signal intensities in deposited CCs for both, shroom3++ and shroom3-- show a similar pattern of decreasing tdTomato signal intensity with progressive CC depositions. Similarly, when looking at ungrouped CC signal intensity (not per CC, but as one group), no difference can be detected (figure 3.29B). While there is no difference in relative numbers of atoh1a expressing cells within the migrating pLLP throughout time (figure 3.29C), when comparing mean cell counts at specific intervals the numbers reveal a significant increase from 0  3 and 12  15 hours for shroom3-- embryos(figure 3.29C). The extrusions to the left in the Kymographs in figure 3.29D are representative to the elongating pLLP during the process of CC deposition. Magenta curves represent expression of atoh1a. For the shroom3-- pLLP, premature expression of atoh1a can be detected. The diagonal lines in the kymographs in figure 3.29D represent the moving pLLP along the LL. Vertical curves represent deposited CCs. As for the registered pLLP, Magenta curves represent expression of atoh1a. Figure 3.29: Hair-cell specification in the LL. A and B Maximum tdTomato intensities in the pLLP and CCs. All CC lifetimes were normalized to the timepoint of deposition (timepoint zero, highlighted by striped vertical line). pLLP intensities are shown to the right (black curve), CC intensities are shown on a negative scale to the left (colored curves).

D-D Kymographs along the horizontal midline showing nascent signal of Tom (in magenta) D two individual pLLPs that were registered in time and to the leading edge. And D Tom signal during LL development. Deposition and position of the first CC is more independent of Shroom3 (section 3.2.2.2) than for the remaining CCs. Interestingly during the first four hours, when the first CC is deposited, analysis of hair-cell specification shows that not only the promotor for atoh1a is more active in shroom3-- embryos (figure 3.29 A and B), but also that more cells are differentiating to become HCs (figure 3.29C and C). This leads to the conclusion that the morphological changes introduced by the shroom3 mutation lead to a pre-mature activation of the shroom3 promotor, subsequently leading to deposition of the CC the HC is associated with. 3.2.6.3 Morphogen Rescue As stated in section 1.1.3.2 and ??, FGF plays a key role during LL development and, additionally, more recent research shows that levels FGF activity have direct impact on the number of CCs deposited (17). Since in embryos deficient for Shroom3 there are significantly more CCs deposited and since we observe a pre-mature activation of Atoh1a (which activates FGF signaling), we wanted to test whether the increase in CCs deposited can be explained by an increase in FGF activity. Inhibition of FGF also reduces LL length (17, 32). Therefore, a titration series experiment with an FGF inhibitor (SU5402) was planned to find a concentration that would not affect the length of the LL but still restore shroom3++ levels of CC count. Figure 3.30: Titration of FGF inhibitor. A LL lengths are reduced with increased concentrations of FGF inhibitor and B groupwise comparison of the length normalized cluster count per concentration of FGF inhibitor. Concentrations 0.10 and 0.20 \\(\\mu\\)M do not show a significant reduction in LL length, but they also do not exhibit any difference in CC count. While the titration worked out well, we reach wildtype levels of CC count only at a concentration of 1 \\(\\mu\\)M of SU5402, however at this concentration the LL length is also reduced by ~ 1 mm. Since FGF plays a crucial role in many developmental processes and since SU5402 affects all of these, \\(H_0\\) can at this point neither be rejected nor accepted. More precise methods need to be applied. Table 3.11: Morphogen rescue dataset summary shroom3++ shroom3 genotype conc. (\\(\\mu\\)M) LLs genotype conc.

To test this hypothesis, I injected shroom3-- embryos with an anti-sense morpholino (MO) that had previously been shown to inhibit atoh1a mRNA translation. Furthermore, since many MOs have been shown to induce unspecific, p53-mediated cell death (72), in a second group I co-injected embryos with an MO for p53 (section 2.1.9 for details about MOs). Interestingly injection of atoh1a MO leads to a loss of the first CC, usually deposited at around 400 \\(\\mu\\)m distance from the otic vesicle (figure 3.31A). Furthermore, while median CC counts in atoh1a MO injected shroom3-- embryos are actually restored to shroom3++ levels, CC counts in shroom3++ embryos are significantly reduced as well. Figure 3.31: atoh1a knockdown. A CC mean positions and B groupwise comparison of the length normalized cluster count. In the expression analysis of atoh1a in shroom3-- embryos I could show a premature activity of Atoh1a in the pLLP. When trying to rescue the phenotype by knocking down atoh1a, neither in shroom3-- nor in shroom3++ embryos the first NM is deposited anymore. Both of these results would in theory argue for an Atoh1a dependent mechanism of CC deposition, however this result has not been reported before and would need further validation. Furthermore, even though an MO for p53 was co-injected, MO injection has been shown to potentially have many more unspecific effects due to the high concentrations usually injected (73). For this reason double mutants ( shroom3--; atoh1a--) were generated - which at this timepoints however are not analyzed yet.

Also, variance is much more affected, such that the error bars extend those of shroom3++ in both maximum and minimum. Rosettiness however, the normalized rosette weight, is much more drastically affected ((3.20)C and C). While the median rosettiness of shroom3++ is at a constant level of about 0.9, shroom3-- rosettiness starts out at about 0.5 but then linearly grows until it also reaches levels of about 0.9 at 16-20 hours of migration. As for rosette detection, variance is much higher. Rosettiness is strongly correlated to the final number of CCs deposited (3.21B) which is also evidenced by rescue of correlation between rosettiness at the beginning of migration and CC count at the end of migration (3.22C), concluding that rosettiness is the key parameter for the future outcome of CC pattern. Still, the question is what determines rosette weight. Although speed and rosettiness are correlated only weakly, they are significantly stronger correlated in shroom3-- than they are in shroom3++ embryos throughout time (3.21A). This finding is also confirmed by an experiment where the CC count of shroom3-- can be rescued when incubated at lower temperature (section 3.2.2.4). In conclusion these results lead to the conclusion that shroom3-- rosettes are destabilized with increasing thermodynamics. 4.2.2 Apical Constriction The method developed to quantify AC allows measurement along two orthogonal axes, the major (the longer axis) and a minor (the shorter axis), of an ellipse fitted to a cellular cross-section at a distinct distance from the apical site. In addition, the cells orientation in degrees from the horizontal midline is obtained (3.27A-A). In summary, AC is significantly reduced in shroom3-- embryos for the severe phenotype. In more detail the results show an increased axial an-isotropy, meaning that AC is more reduced along the major than along the minor axis. In conclusion this means that AC and probably tension is more relaxed along the anterior-posterior axis. In terms of cell shape this means that rosette cells go from a pyramidal geometry, more to a prism geometry (4.1). This is also confirmed by angular measurement which show that for 0-15\\(^\\circ\\) more shroom3-- pLLPs cells are aggregated while at 30-45\\(^\\circ\\), more shroom3++ cells are aggregated. Figure 4.1: Rosette and Cell Shape Model Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) is a peripheral membrane, tight-junction associated protein. Within the apical region of pLLP rosettes Fgf filled luminal structures are developing that that are hubs for locally confined morphogen signaling. All cells of a rosette make up and are connected to a single lumen. When visualizing the lumen via an antibody for ZO-1, the lumen appears like a buckyball where each side is the connection to a single cell (17). While in shroom3++ rosettes those structures appear circular in the trailing rosette, in shroom3-- rosettes they appear more oval (supplement, (A.4), which supports the theory of an-isotropy. Furthermore, in more leading regions the signal is more fragmented, which supports the theory of micro-rosette structures. 4.2.3 Model Based on these results - In contrast to the current model - the shroom3-- phenotype is not defined by an absence of rosettes but by a greater than or equal to amount that are smaller and have less weight. Those micro-rosettes will eventually be deposited, leading to somewhat smaller CCs, which is also supported by analysis of emerging hair cells in the pLLP. The results are summarized and graphically modeled in figure 2. Figure 4.2: Shroom3 dependent rosette formation "],["5-discussion.html", "Chapter 5 Discussion 5.1 Methods 5.2 Shroom3", " Chapter 5 Discussion Due to the pLLPs relative simplicity (~100 cells) and excellent accessibility for advanced light-microscopes (~1 cell layer beneath the skin), it promises an in toto understanding and complete model of factors influencing its development. To create a robust model, it is necessary to have robust methods that allow to generate large datasets of precise and meaningful measurements. The tools and methods developed for this work have proven very useful in pinning down of essential developmental aspects and answering important biological questions with quantitative certainty. Still, due to the complexity of biological systems some points remain open for discussion. 5.1 Methods 5.1.1 Mounting 5.2 Shroom3 5.2.1 Lateral Line Two additional CCs are deposited in shroom3-- embryos (section 3.2.2.2) leading to a net increase in cell count of ~9\\(\\%\\) (31 cells) (section 3.2.2.3). However, proliferation is not increased in the pLLP (section 3.2.3.2) but in CCs once they are deposited (section 3.2.3.2). Therefore, the increase in CC count is unrelated to the amount of proliferation in the pLLP. The cell count and area per CC show an average reduction of 6\\(\\%\\) respectively and no difference for the density (section 3.2.2.3). The shroom3-- LL phenotype can be mimicked by inhibition of Rock but not rescued by induction of Rock (section 3.2.4.7), leading to the conclusion that Rock is necessary for proper rosette assembly and CC deposition, but not sufficient. CC count can also be rescued by ectopic expression of a Shroom3-RFP fusion protein (section 3.2.4.6), leading to the conclusion that Shroom3 has a spatiotemporal function necessary and sufficient for proper LL development. The reduction is supported scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures of 3 dpf (supplement, A.1) NMs, which indicate a disruption bundled kinocilia. However, as hair cells do still develop (supplement, A.2), there is no reason to presume that shroom3-- NMs suffered from a loss of function. End of migration analysis also shows that the average length of the LL does not differ, suggesting that speed is not affected. This is confirmed by time-lapse analysis, which neither shows a difference in speed of migration, nor in acceleration (results, 3.18). 5.2.2 Proliferation Due to their high regenerative ability, zebrafish are a popular model in regenerative research (24, 27, 74). It is well known that zebrafish NMs have a very high regenerative capacity (7577). For proliferation no difference in the mitotic rate could be detected in the pLLP which lead to the conclusion that additional CC deposition was independent. However, previous reports have shown a bias in location and direction of mitoses in the pLLP (28, 65). Since our model supposed that rosette cells are more oriented along the horizontal midline this could mean that even though there are not more mitoses overall, the mitotic axis is also directed more along A-P. This in turn would result in more cells along this direction, potentially decreasing tension, leading to pre-mature deposition. 5.2.3 Rosette Detection Deep learning methods are currently, driven by the hype of artificial intelligence, extremely en vogue. While their use is not always justified, especially for biomedial image analysis they have proven extremely powerful (68, 78, 79). With the used fluorescent membrane label epithelial rosettes are relatively simple to detect, even with traditional image processing techniques. The arguably biggest point for criticism is that one usually does not know the features the network has learned to detect. An important metric, besides the plain detection, is the softmax-score25. It is a metric that tells about the security of the network how safe it is in its prediction. We interpreted this score in a way that lower prediction scores are representative for weaker rosettes. 5.2.4 Hair Cell specification In the pLLP, Notch signaling is important for selection and specification of hair-cells (1.1.3.3). Interestingly, our findings are supported by another study where it was shown that upon over-activated Notch signaling, CC deposition happened independent of Shroom3 (80). For our observation this could mean that (1) either expression of atoh1a is up-regulated due to a compensation mechanism to ensure CC deposition or (2) that the cellular rearrangements lead to biased Notch signaling. A phenomenon that in fact has been well studied (5). For the latter, the proposed model would be that in each micro-rosette the HC is in contact with less cells, but the amount of Notch ligand stays the same. Therefore, lateral inhibition and feedback is stronger, leading to an increase in expression of atoh1a and ultimately to premature CC deposition. Even though the dataset for hair-cell specification provided a lot of datapoints for statistical testing, the difference for cell counts show only a relatively low significance. This could be attributed to the large variance in measurements. On the other side, not only is there a significant increase in cell count in shroom3-- pLLPs but also a higher activity of the atoh1a promotor. When controlling these results by trying to rescue the shroom3-- with a atoh1a knockdown, neither in shroom3-- nor in shroom3++ embryos the first NM is deposited anymore. Both of these results would in theory argue for an Atoh1a dependent mechanism of CC deposition, however this result has not been reported before and would need further validation. Furthermore, even though an MO for p53 was co-injected, MO injection has been shown to potentially have many more unspecific effects due to the high concentrations usually injected (73). For this reason double mutants ( shroom3--; atoh1a--) were generated - which at this timepoints however are not analyzed yet. 5.2.5 Single cell reconstruction and AC measurement Earlier attempts for indexing AC include measuring the apical index (A.I.) of bottle cells during X.laevis gastrulation (81) or the ACI for cells of the pLLP (57). For both, the metric describes the ratio of lateral height over apical width which, depending on the situation, is a very coarse and inaccurate description. In the pLLP cells of different forms, volumes and heights can be found. When measuring apical width at a fix distance from the apical site cells with different height but otherwise equal degree of AC turn out to have a very different ACI (2.9A and A). If however apical width is measured at a distance relative to the cells height, cells turn out to have the same ACI (2.9A and A). In addition, it remains questionable exactly how to define apical width in a two-dimensional cellular cross-section. By introducing apical width measurement along both, the major and the minor axis (section 2.2.4.4.1.3), the improved model for AC and method for automated and unbiased cellular segmentation therefore represents a major advancement. AC is also correlated with cell height. To get a more detailed impression about how variables are distributed within the cells of the pLLP, single cell measurements of pLLPs that are normalized in orientation can be superimposed in a two-dimensional map of organ length and width. Next, cell coordinates in this map can be grouped into bins of hexagons and the summary statistic represented as color on a continuous scale (5.1). Doing so reveals that for stages 32 and 36 hpf, height in shroom3-- cells is not as strongly reduced as in SU5402 treated ones and that cells in the central region of the pLLP are higher than in the leading, trailing and lateral regions. In this specific case this may not lead to new insights, but it improves the visual perception and therefore may assist more concise questioning and reasoning. Figure 5.1: pLLP Maps. The QR code links to the LLMapR web-app (dskleinhans.shinyapps.io/LLmapR). In addition to visualization, large multidimensional datasets offer the possibility for advanced computational methods such as Machine- and Deep learning. For example, one could use clustering methods such as Principal Component Analysis to find out which dimensions contribute the most to separate a number of clusters from each other (5.2). Another scenario would be to manually label cells of a dataset as either leading, trailing, rosette, lateral,  etc. to train an Machine learning model on. The model could then be used on unlabeled data to assign the previous learned labels to cells that fit the right parameters. Figure 5.2: Principal Component Analysis A and B show dimension 1 (explaining 42.6\\(\\%\\) of the data) and dimension 2(explaining 23.3\\(\\%\\) of the data) in a scatter plot. The bigger dots represent the respective centers. Ellipsoids show the spread of the data. In addition B shows the individual principal components. The arrows direction is the PCs direction, the length represents its importance. Yet another application example would be to use the ground truth image data generated for my studies to train a CNN that potentially would be more robust to data of different quality / resolution and easier to use as it wouldnt require as much pre-processing.

When dephosphorylated, Yap and Taz translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to induce target gene expression. To check for differences in hippo signaling, immunostainings for Taz were performed. On average the immunostainings suggest that Taz localization is more concentrated in the leading region and in the nuclei of peripherical PLLp cells. Figure A.5: Hippo Signaling in the pLLP.
