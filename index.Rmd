# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content here or
# use code similar to line 20 for the files.  If you are producing in a different
# format than PDF, you can delete or ignore lines 20-31 in this YAML header.
#abstract: |
#  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00-abstract.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline
# like below, use a command like that for the abstract above.  Note that a tab is 
# needed on the line after the |.,

preface: |
  > "The most exciting time in the history of developmental biology is right now. Fueled both by new technologies and by new thought from other fields, we are exploding old notions and opening fantastic new horizons in embryology. [...]
  
  > Next, let’s discuss why developmental biology — both normal and pathological — holds such enduring fascination. I see two intertwined explanations. Obviously, it’s the ultimate personal creation story, telling each of us both where we came from and how we were constructed. Less obvious, but perhaps more tantalizing for us scientists, is the sheer complexity of the process. A single cell with a single genome can somehow create tril
  lions of cells in hundreds of radically different types, and those cells can organize themselves into a specific form. The scale of this self-organization process is mind boggling, surely the most amazing of emergent properties."
