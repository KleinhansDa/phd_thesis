##### Plasmid preparation {#miniprep}

To pellet bacteria in a 1.5 or 2 mL tube, the bacteria were centrifuged in 2 mL tubes for 3 min. at 12000 rpm. To solve the pellet, the supernatant and 200 $\mu$L of buffer P1 (section \@ref(mat-buff)) were added followed by thorough vortexing. To lyse the bacteria 400 $\mu$L of P2 were added, standing still. After a maximum of 5 min. 300 $\mu$L of P3 were added to neutralize the reaction and bind cellular material, and the tube was inverted five to six times.

To harvest the plasmid DNA the solution was then first centrifuged for 10 min. at 12000 rpm and at RT. After, the supernatant was transferred to a new 2 mL tube. Second, to precipitate the DNA, 700 $\mu$L of iso-propanol were added and centrifuged for 20 min. at full speed and at 4$^\circ$C. After, the tube was checked for a opaque pellet and the supernatant was discarded. Third, to wash the pellet, 200 $\mu$L of 70$%$ EtOH were added and centrifuged for 7 min. at full speed and at 4$^\circ$C. The supernatant was discarded again. Finally, the pellet was air dryed under the hood and re-suspended in 50 $\mu$L ddH\textsubscript{2}O.
