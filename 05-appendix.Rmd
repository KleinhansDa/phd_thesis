An important regulator for proliferation and organ size is the mechanosensitive hippo signaling pathway where the transcription factors Yap and Taz are the most downstream targets. When dephosphorylated, Yap and Taz translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to induce target gene expression. 
To check for differences in hippo signaling, immunostainings for Taz were performed. On average the immunostainings suggest that Taz localization is more concentrated in the leading region and in the nuclei of peripherical pLLP cells.

The CC pattern for both _shrm3_++ and _shroom3_$--$ can be modeled by a phase modulated cosine (figure 1), where the power to x represents the phase and is increased by only 0.1 in _shroom3_$--$ to go from a CC count of 5 to 7 over a span of 20 hours.
