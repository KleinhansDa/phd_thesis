abstract = {Embryonic morphogenesis requires the execution of complex mechanisms that regulate the local behaviour of groups of cells. The orchestration of such mechanisms has been mainly deciphered through the identification of conserved families of signalling pathways that spatially and temporally control cell behaviour. However, how this information is processed to control cell shape and cell dynamics is an open area of investigation. The framework that emerges from diverse disciplines such as cell biology, physics and developmental biology points to adhesion and cortical actin networks as regulators of cell surface mechanics. In this context, a range of developmental phenomena can be explained by the regulation of cell surface tension.},

abstract = {Sensory placodes are unique columnar epithelia with neurogenic potential that develop in the vertebrate head ectoderm next to the neural tube. They contribute to the paired sensory organs and the cranial sensory ganglia generating a wide variety of cell types ranging from lens fibres to sensory receptor cells and neurons. Although progress has been made in recent years to identify the molecular players that mediate placode specification, induction and patterning, the processes that initiate placode development are not well understood. One hypothesis suggests that all placode precursors arise from a common territory, the pre-placodal region, which is then subdivided to generate placodes of specific character. This model implies that their induction begins through molecular and cellular mechanisms common to all placodes. Embryological and molecular evidence suggests that placode induction is a multi-step process and that the molecular networks establishing the pre-placodal domain as well as the acquisition of placodal identity are surprisingly similar to those used in Drosophila to specify sensory structures. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Large tumor suppressor (Lats) is a Ser/Thr kinase, and it presents an important function in tumor suppression. lats was originally identified in Drosophila and recently in mammals. In mammals, it contains two homologues, lats1 and lats2. In the present study, lats1 and lats2 were characterized from zebrafish (Danio rerio), which is the first report of lats in a nonmammalian vertebrate. The primary structure, genomic organization, and phylogenesis of lats from different species were studied, and the results suggest that lats1 is the direct descendant of invertebrate lats, whereas lats2 is formed by genome duplication. In zebrafish, both lats genes are maternally expressed, while they show distinctly different expression profiles during gastrulation. lats1 is almost ubiquitously expressed through development, and lats2 is more prominently expressed in the non-neural ectoderm region of zebrafish gastrula. Most intriguingly, as revealed by cell tracing and gene expression analysis, morpholino-mediated knockdown of either lats1 or lats2 led to obvious defects of cell migration in gastrulation, indicating the functional significance of lats in gastrulation movements.},

abstract = {The conserved Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals and has an essential role in tumor suppression and the control of cell proliferation. Recent studies identified activators of Hippo signaling, but antagonists of the pathway have remained largely elusive. In this paper, we show that NPHP4, a known cilia-associated protein that is mutated in the severe degenerative renal disease nephronophthisis, acts as a potent negative regulator of mammalian Hippo signaling. NPHP4 directly interacted with the kinase Lats1 and inhibited Lats1-mediated phosphorylation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding domain), leading to derepression of these protooncogenic transcriptional regulators. Moreover, NPHP4 induced release from 14-3-3 binding and nuclear translocation of YAP and TAZ, promoting TEA domain (TEAD)/TAZ/YAP-dependent transcriptional activity. Consistent with these data, knockdown of NPHP4 negatively affected cellular proliferation and TEAD/TAZ activity, essentially phenocopying loss of TAZ function. These data identify NPHP4 as a negative regulator of the Hippo pathway and suggest that NPHP4 regulates cell proliferation through its effects on Hippo signaling.},

METHODS: A concise review of surfactants and micelles applications in pharmacy was carried out. RESULTS: Initially, a description of surfactants and aqueous micellar systems is presented. Following, an extensive review on micellar drug solubilization, including both the principles involved on this phenomenon and the work already done regarding solubilization of drugs by micelles is presented. The application of micelles in drug delivery, in order to minimize drug degradation and loss, to prevent harmful side effects, and to increase drug bioavailability, is also presented. Special emphasis is given to the more recent use of polymeric micelles. Finally, we briefly discuss the importance of surfactants and micelles as biological systems models as well as its application in micellar catalysis. CONCLUSIONS: As can be seen from the review presented, the use of micelles in pharmacy is an important tool that finds numerous applications.},

Compared to conventional homology-based gene targeting, ZFNs can increase the targeting rate by up to 100,000-fold; gene disruption via mutagenic DNA repair is similarly efficient. The utility of ZFNs has been shown in many organisms, including insects, amphibians, plants, nematodes, and several mammals, including humans.

abstract = {The primary cilium is a non-motile singular cellular structure that extends from the surface of nearly every cell in the body. The cilium has been shown to play numerous roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis, through regulating signaling pathways and sensing both biophysical and biochemical changes in the extracellular environment. The structural performance of the cilium is paramount to its function as defective cilia have been linked to numerous pathologies. In particular, the cilium has demonstrated a mechanosensory role in tissues such as the kidney, liver, endothelium and bone, where cilium deflection under mechanical loading triggers a cellular response. Understanding of how cilium structure and subsequent mechanical behavior contributes to the roles that cilium plays in regulating cellular behavior is a compelling question, yet is a relatively untouched research area. Recent advances in biophysical measurements have demonstrated the cilium to be a structurally intricate organelle containing an array of load bearing proteins. Furthermore advances in modeling of this organelle have revealed the importance of these proteins at regulating the cilium's mechanosensitivity. Remarkably, the cilium is capable of adapting its mechanical state, altering its length and possibly it's bending resistance, to regulate its mechanosensitivity demonstrating the importance of cilium mechanics in cellular responses. In this review, we introduce the cilium as a mechanosensor; discuss the advances in the mechanical modeling of cilia; explore the structural features of the cilium, which contribute to its mechanics and finish with possible mechanisms in which alteration in structure may affect ciliary mechanics, consequently affecting ciliary based mechanosensing. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The role for cilia in establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) is contentious. Although knockdown of genes known to function in ciliogenesis has been reported to cause PCP-related morphogenesis defects in zebrafish, genetic mutations affecting intraflagellar transport (IFT) do not show PCP phenotypes despite the requirement for IFT in cilia formation. This discrepancy has been attributed to off-target effects of antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) injection, confounding maternal effects in zygotic mutant embryos, or an inability to distinguish between cilia-dependent versus cilia-independent protein functions. To determine the role of cilia in PCP, we generated maternal+ zygotic IFT88 (MZ. ift88) mutant zebrafish embryos, which never form cilia. We clearly demonstrate that cilia are not required to establish PCP. Rather, IFT88 plays a cilia-independent role in controlling oriented cell divisions at gastrulation and neurulation. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of cilia gene function in normal development and in disease},

abstract = {Collective migration of cells in the zebrafish Posterior Lateral Line primordium (PLLp) along a path defined by Cxcl12a expression depends on Cxcr4b receptors in leading cells and on Cxcr7b in trailing cells. Cxcr7b-mediated degradation of Cxcl12a by trailing cells generates a local gradient of Cxcl12a that guides PLLp migration. Agent-based computer models were built to explore how a polarized response to Cxcl12a, mediated by Cxcr4b in leading cells and prevented by Cxcr7b in trailing cells, determines unidirectional migration of the PLLp. These chemokine signaling-based models effectively recapitulate many behaviors of the PLLp and provide potential explanations for the characteristic behaviors that emerge when the PLLp is severed by laser to generate leading and trailing fragments. As predicted by our models, the bilateral stretching of the leading fragment is lost when chemokine signaling is blocked in the PLLp. However, movement of the trailing fragment toward the leading cells, which was also thought to be chemokine dependent, persists. This suggested that a chemokine-independent mechanism, not accounted for in our models, is responsible for this behavior. Further investigation of trailing cell behavior shows that their movement toward leading cells depends on FGF signaling and it can be re-oriented by exogenous FGF sources. Together, our observations reveal the simple yet elegant manner in which leading and trailing cells coordinate migration; while leading cells steer PLLp migration by following chemokine cues, cells further back play follow-the-leader as they migrate toward FGFs produced by leading cells.},

abstract = {Medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a small freshwater teleost that provides an excellent developmental genetic model complementary to zebrafish. Our recent mutagenesis screening using medaka identified headfish (hdf) which is characterized by the absence of trunk and tail structures with nearly normal head including the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB). Positional-candidate cloning revealed that the hdf mutation causes a functionally null form of Fgfr1. The fgfr1hdf is thus the first fgf receptor mutant in fish. Although FGF signaling has been implicated in mesoderm induction, mesoderm is induced normally in the fgfr1hdf mutant, but subsequently, mutant embryos fail to maintain the mesoderm, leading to defects in mesoderm derivatives, especially in trunk and tail. Furthermore, we found that morpholino knockdown of medaka fgf8 resulted in a phenotype identical to the fgfr1hdf mutant, suggesting that like its mouse counterpart, Fgf8 is a major ligand for Fgfr1 in medaka early embryogenesis. Intriguingly, Fgf8 and Fgfr1 in zebrafish are also suggested to form a major ligand-receptor pair, but their function is much diverged, as the zebrafish fgfr1 morphant and zebrafish fgf8 mutant acerebellar (ace) only fail to develop the MHB, but develop nearly unaffected trunk and tail. These results provide evidence that teleost fish have evolved divergent functions of Fgf8-Fgfr1 while maintaining the ligand-receptor relationships. Comparative analysis using different fish is thus invaluable for shedding light on evolutionary diversification of gene function.},

abstract = {SHP2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase, deregulation of which is associated with malignant neoplasms and developmental disorders. SHP2 is required for full activation of RAS-Erk signaling in the cytoplasm and is also present in the nucleus, where it promotes Wnt target gene activation through dephosphorylation of parafibromin. SHP2 is distributed both to the cytoplasm and nucleus at low cell density but is excluded from the nucleus at high cell density. Here, we show that SHP2 physically interacts with transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, targets of the cell-density-sensing Hippo signal. Through the interaction, nonphosphorylated YAP/TAZ promote nuclear translocalization of SHP2, which in turn stimulates TCF/LEF- and TEAD-regulated genes via parafibromin dephosphorylation. Conversely, YAP/TAZ phosphorylated by Hippo signaling sequester SHP2 in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing nuclear accumulation of SHP2. Hence, YAP/TAZ serve as a rheostat for nuclear SHP2 function, which is switched off by the Hippo signal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The oncogenic Yki/YAP transcriptional coactivator family promotes tissue growth by activating target gene transcription, but the regulation of Yki/YAP activation remains elusive. In mammalian cells, we identified Brg1, a major subunit of chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF family proteins, which interacts with YAP. This finding led us to investigate the in vivo functional interaction of Yki and Brahma (Brm), the Drosophila homolog of Brg1. We found that Brm functions at the downstream of Hippo pathway and interacts with Yki and Scalloped (Sd) to promotes Yki-dependent transcription and tissue growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Brm is required for the Crumbs (Crb) dysregulation-induced Yki activation. Interestingly, we also found that crb is a downstream target of Yki-Brm complex. Brm physically binds to the promoter of crb and regulates its transcription through Yki. Together, we showed that Brm functions as a critical regulator of Hippo signaling during tissue growth and plays an important role in the feedback loop between Crb and Yki.},

abstract = {The precise regulation of numbers and types of neurons through control of cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation is an essential aspect of neurogenesis. The Hippo signaling pathway has recently been identified as playing a crucial role in promoting cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation in multiple types of stem cells, including in retinal progenitor cells. When Hippo signaling is activated, the core Mst1/2 kinases activate the Lats1/2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and inhibit the transcriptional cofactor Yap. During mouse retinogenesis, overexpression of Yap prolongs progenitor cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of Yap decreases this proliferation and promotes retinal cell differentiation. However, to date, it remains unknown how the Hippo pathway affects the differentiation of distinct neuronal cell types such as photoreceptor cells. In this study, we investigated whether Hippo signaling regulates retinogenesis during early zebrafish development. Knockdown of zebrafish mst2 induced early embryonic defects, including altered retinal pigmentation and morphogenesis. Similar abnormal retinal phenotypes were observed in zebrafish embryos injected with a constitutively active form of yap [(yap (5SA)]. Loss of Yap's TEAD-binding domain, two WW domains, or transcription activation domain attenuated the retinal abnormalities induced by yap (5SA), indicating that all of these domains contribute to normal retinal development. Remarkably, yap (5SA)-expressing zebrafish embryos displayed decreased expression of transcription factors such as otx5 and crx, which orchestrate photoreceptor cell differentiation by activating the expression of rhodopsin and other photoreceptor cell genes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Rx1 is a novel interacting partner of Yap that regulates photoreceptor cell differentiation. Our results suggest that Yap suppresses the differentiation of photoreceptor cells from retinal progenitor cells by repressing Rx1-mediated transactivation of photoreceptor cell genes during zebrafish retinogenesis.},

abstract = {Annelida is one of three animal groups possessing segmentation and is central in considerations about the evolution of different character traits. It has even been proposed that the bilaterian ancestor resembled an annelid. However, a robust phylogeny of Annelida, especially with respect to the basal relationships, has been lacking. Our study based on transcriptomic data comprising 68,750-170,497 amino acid sites from 305 to 622 proteins resolves annelid relationships, including Chaetopteridae, Amphinomidae, Sipuncula, Oweniidae, and Magelonidae in the basal part of the tree. Myzostomida, which have been indicated to belong to the basal radiation as well, are now found deeply nested within Annelida as sister group to Errantia in most analyses. On the basis of our reconstruction of a robust annelid phylogeny, we show that the basal branching taxa include a huge variety of life styles such as tube dwelling and deposit feeding, endobenthic and burrowing, tubicolous and filter feeding, and errant and carnivorous forms. Ancestral character state reconstruction suggests that the ancestral annelid possessed a pair of either sensory or grooved palps, bicellular eyes, biramous parapodia bearing simple chaeta, and lacked nuchal organs. Because the oldest fossil of Annelida is reported for Sipuncula (520 Ma), we infer that the early diversification of annelids took place at least in the Lower Cambrian.},

Here, we examine the pattern of cell proliferation in the posterior lateral line system. We conclude that three phases of cell proliferation are involved in the generation of this system, separated by two phases of mitotic quiescence. The first phase corresponds to generalized proliferation during gastrulation, followed by a first period of quiescence that may be related to the determination of the lateral line precursor cells. A second phase of proliferation takes place in the placode and migrating primordium. This region is organized in annuli that correspond to the expression of proneural/neurogenic genes. A second period of quiescence follows, corresponding to deposition and differentiation of the sensory organs. The third period of proliferation corresponds to continued renewal of hair cells by division of support cells within each sensory organ.},

abstract = {Summary Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) is a multifaceted process that causes many cell types to repel each other upon collision. During development, this seemingly uncoordinated reaction is a critical driver of cellular dispersion within embryonic tissues. Here, we show that Drosophila hemocytes require a precisely orchestrated CIL response for their developmental dispersal. Hemocyte collision and subsequent repulsion involves a stereotyped sequence of kinematic stages that are modulated by global changes in cytoskeletal dynamics. Tracking actin retrograde flow within hemocytes in vivo reveals synchronous reorganization of colliding actin networks through engagement of an inter-cellular adhesion. This inter-cellular actin-clutch leads to a subsequent build-up in lamellar tension, triggering the development of a transient stress fiber, which orchestrates cellular repulsion. Our findings reveal that the physical coupling of the flowing actin networks during CIL acts as a mechanotransducer, allowing cells to haptically sense each other and coordinate their behaviors.},

Not surprisingly, ncRNAs are involved also in human diseases, such as cancer and metabolic and neuronal disorders.

Embryonic patterns are largely conserved among teleosts, yet adult patterns are highly diverse. Although changes in pattern modify the perceptual abilities of the system, their developmental origin remains unknown. Here we compare the processes that underlie the formation of the juvenile PLL pattern in Thunnus thynnus, the bluefin tuna, to the processes that were elucidated in Danio rerio, the zebrafish. In both cases, the embryonic PLL comprises five neuromasts regularly spaced along the horizontal myoseptum, but the juvenile PLL comprises four roughly parallel anteroposterior lines in zebrafish, whereas it is a simple dorsally arched line in tuna fish. We examined whether this difference involves evolutionary novelties, and show that the same mechanisms mediate the transition from embryonic to juvenile patterns in both species. We conclude that the marked difference in juveniles depends on a single change (dorsal vs. ventral migration of neuromasts) in the first days of larval life.},

abstract = {The sense organs of the posterior lateral line system (neuromasts) are formed by a migrating primordium. In zebrafish, the primordium comprises approximately 100 cells at the onset of migration, and has deposited approximately 300 cells by the end of the process. Here, we report localized phases of mitotic activity and of mitotic quiescence within the migrating primordium. Quiescence in the leading region seems associated to the formation of a new prospective neuromast, whereas quiescence in the trailing region follows a wave of mitoses that synchronize trailing cells in G0/G1 phase, anticipating neuromast differentiation. Manipulating the size of the primordium does not lead to changes in the rate of cell proliferation. We also show that two mitoses often take place nearly synchronously in adjacent cells, suggestive of a determinate lineage. We conclude that proliferation in the migrating primordium follows a stereotyped pattern that closely anticipates the normal development of the system.},

abstract = {Primary cilia have recently been highlighted as key regulators in development and disease. This review focuses on current work demonstrating the broad role of cilia-related proteins in developmental signaling systems. Of particular consideration is the importance of the basal body region, located at the base of the cilium, in its role as a focal point for many signaling pathways and as a microtubule organizing center. As the cilium is effectively a microtubular extension of the cytoskeleton, investigating connections between the cilium and the cytoskeleton provides greater insight into signaling and cell function. Of the many signaling pathways associated with primary cilia, the most extensively studied in association with the cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal rearrangements are both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. One of the key concepts currently emerging is a possible additional role for the traditionally 'cilia-related' proteins in other aspects of cellular processes. In many cases, disruption of such processes manifests at the level of the cilium. While the involvement of cilia and cilia-related proteins in signaling pathways is currently being unraveled, there is a growing body of evidence to support the notion that ciliary proteins are required not only for regulation of Wnt signaling, but also as downstream effectors of Wnt signaling. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the involvement of cilia and basal body proteins in Wnt signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Apical constriction facilitates epithelial sheet bending and invagination during morphogenesis. Apical constriction is conventionally thought to be driven by the continuous purse-string-like contraction of a circumferential actin and non-muscle myosin-II (myosin) belt underlying adherens junctions. However, it is unclear whether other force-generating mechanisms can drive this process. Here we show, with the use of real-time imaging and quantitative image analysis of Drosophila gastrulation, that the apical constriction of ventral furrow cells is pulsed. Repeated constrictions, which are asynchronous between neighbouring cells, are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cell apex is maintained. In contrast to the purse-string model, constriction pulses are powered by actin-myosin network contractions that occur at the medial apical cortex and pull discrete adherens junction sites inwards. The transcription factors Twist and Snail differentially regulate pulsed constriction. Expression of snail initiates actin-myosin network contractions, whereas expression of twist stabilizes the constricted state of the cell apex. Our results suggest a new model for apical constriction in which a cortical actin-myosin cytoskeleton functions as a developmentally controlled subcellular ratchet to reduce apical area incrementally.},

abstract = {Nephronophthisis (NPH) is a genetically heterogenous kidney disease and represents the most common genetic cause for end-stage renal disease in children. It is caused by the mutation of genes encoding for the nephrocystin proteins (NPHPs) which localize to primary cilia or centrosomes, classifying this disease as a 'ciliopathy'. Recently, it has been shown that NPHP4 acts as a potent negative regulator of mammalian Hippo signalling by interacting with the Lats protein kinase and controlling the phosphorylation of the oncogenic transcriptional activator TAZ. Here, we demonstrate that NPHP9, another NPH family member, also controls TAZ activity by a distinct mechanism. NPHP9, which is also called NEK8, directly interacted with TAZ and induced nuclear translocation of the TAZ/NPHP9 protein complex. Binding of NPHP9 to TAZ was enhanced in a TAZ mutant that lost its ability to bind 14-3-3, suggesting that 14-3-3 and NPHP9 may compete for TAZ binding, with 14-3-3 favouring cytoplasmic retention and NPHP9 mediating nuclear delivery. Consistently, co-expression of NPHP4, which inhibits TAZ phosphorylation at the 14-3-3 binding site through the inhibition of Lats kinase activity, induced efficient nuclear delivery of the TAZ/NPHP9 protein pair. Consistent with a role for TAZ in controlling proliferation and tumorigenesis, the downregulation of NPHP9 inhibited the TAZ-dependent proliferation of hippo-responsive normal epithelial and also breast cancer cells. As NPHP9 has been shown to be upregulated in breast cancer, these data do not only support a critical role for TAZ/hippo signalling in the pathogenesis of NPH but may also imply a possible role for NPHP9 in TAZ-mediated tumorigenesis.},

The phase solubility diagrams drawn from UV spectral measurements are of the A(L) type and indicate an enhancement of SMX and TMP solubility in the presence of CDs. Complex formation tendency of TMP with CDs followed the order: $\gamma$-CD {\textgreater} $\beta$-CD {\textgreater} $\alpha$-C. However, the complex formation constant values, for SMX-CD system yielded the different affinity and follow the order: $\beta$-CD {\textgreater} $\gamma$-CD {\textgreater} $\alpha$-CD. With taking into consideration of solubilization capacity of SDS micelles, it has been found that the solubility enhancement of TMP is much higher than that of SMX in the presence of SDS micelles. The binding constants of SMX and TMP obtained from the Benesi-Hildebrand equation are also confirmed by the estimated surface properties of SDS, employing the surface tension measurements. In order to elucidate the solubilization characteristics the surface tension measurements were also performed for nonionic surfactant Triton X-100. Polarity of the microenvironment and probable location of SMX and TMP were also discussed in the presence of various organic solvents.},

As animals develop and age, their organs must remodel and regenerate themselves in response to environmental and physiological demands. Recently, the highly conserved Hippo signaling pathway, discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, has been implicated as a key regulator of organ size control across species. Deregulation is associated with substantial overgrowth phenotypes and eventual onset of cancer in various tissues. Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway can modulate its effects on tissue size by the direct regulation of SC proliferation and maintenance. These findings provide an attractive model for how this pathway might communicate physiological needs for growth to tissue-specific SC pools.

Multilayer mounting, a new embedding technique using low-concentration agarose in optically clear tubes, now overcomes this limitation and unleashes the full potential of light sheet microscopy for real-time developmental biology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Aceto et al. Teleost fish such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) are increasingly used for physiological, genetic and developmental studies. Our understanding of the physiological consequences of altered gravity in an entire organism is still incomplete. We used altered gravity and drug treatment experiments to evaluate their effects specifically on bone formation and more generally on whole genome gene expression. By combining morphometric tools with an objective scoring system for the state of development for each element in the head skeleton and specific gene expression analysis, we confirmed and characterized in detail the decrease or increase of bone formation caused by a 5 day treatment (from 5dpf to 10 dpf) of, respectively parathyroid hormone (PTH) or vitamin D3 (VitD3). Microarray transcriptome analysis after 24 hours treatment reveals a general effect on physiology upon VitD3 treatment, while PTH causes more specifically developmental effects. Hypergravity (3g from 5dpf to 9 dpf) exposure results in a significantly larger head and a significant increase in bone formation for a subset of the cranial bones. Gene expression analysis after 24 hrs at 3g revealed differential expression of genes involved in the development and function of the skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine and cardiovascular systems. Finally, we propose a novel type of experimental approach, the "Reduced Gravity Paradigm", by keeping the developing larvae at 3g hypergravity for the first 5 days before returning them to 1g for one additional day. 5 days exposure to 3g during these early stages also caused increased bone formation, while gene expression analysis revealed a central network of regulatory genes (hes5, sox10, lgals3bp, egr1, edn1, fos, fosb, klf2, gadd45ba and socs3a) whose expression was consistently affected by the transition from hyper- to normal gravity.},

abstract = {By exploiting the cell-cycle-dependent proteolysis of two ubiquitination oscillators, human Cdt1 and geminin, which are the direct substrates of SCF(Skp2) and APC(Cdh1) complexes, respectively, Fucci technique labels mammalian cell nuclei in G(1) and S/G(2)/M phases with different colors. Transgenic mice expressing these G(1) and S/G(2)/M markers offer a powerful means to investigate the coordination of the cell cycle with morphogenetic processes. We attempted to introduce these markers into zebrafish embryos to take advantage of their favorable optical properties. However, although the fundamental mechanisms for cell-cycle control appear to be well conserved among species, the G(1) marker based on the SCF(Skp2)-mediated degradation of human Cdt1 did not work in fish cells, probably because the marker was not ubiquitinated properly by a fish E3 ligase complex. We describe here the generation of a Fucci derivative using zebrafish homologs of Cdt1 and geminin, which provides sweeping views of cell proliferation in whole fish embryos. Remarkably, we discovered two anterior-to-posterior waves of cell-cycle transitions, G(1)/S and M/G(1), in the differentiating notochord. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using the Cul4(Ddb1)-mediated Cdt1 degradation pathway common to all metazoans for the development of a G(1) marker that works in the nonmammalian animal model.},

abstract = {Modular body organization is found widely across multicellular organisms, and some of them form repetitive modular structures via the process of segmentation. It's vastly interesting to understand how these regularly repeated structures are robustly generated from the underlying noise in biomolecular interactions. Recent studies from arthropods reveal similarities in segmentation mechanisms with vertebrates, and raise the possibility that the three phylogenetic clades, annelids, arthropods and chordates, might share homology in this process from a bilaterian ancestor. Here, we discuss vertebrate segmentation with particular emphasis on the role of the Notch intercellular signalling pathway. We introduce vertebrate segmentation and Notch signalling, pointing out historical milestones, then describe existing models for the Notch pathway in the synchronization of noisy neighbouring oscillators, and a new role in the modulation of gene expression wave patterns. We ask what functions Notch signalling may have in arthropod segmentation and explore the relationship between Notch-mediated lateral inhibition and synchronization. Finally, we propose open questions and technical challenges to guide future investigations into Notch signalling in segmentation.},

Although mechanical forces are known to regulate cell and tissue behavior, as well as organogenesis, the precise molecular events that integrate mechanical and biochemical signals to control these processes are not fully known. The recently delineated Hippo-tumor suppressor network and its two nuclear effectors, YAP and TAZ, shed light on these mechanisms. YAP and TAZ are proto-oncogene proteins that respond to complex physical milieu represented by the rigidity of the extracellular matrix, cell geometry, cell density, cell polarity and the status of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we review the current knowledge of how YAP and TAZ function as mechanosensors and mechanotransducers. We also suggest that by deciphering the mechanical and biochemical signals controlling YAP/TAZ function, we will gain insights into new strategies for cancer treatment and organ regeneration.},

abstract = {Ciliopathies are a group of human disorders caused by dysfunction of primary cilia, ubiquitous microtubule-based organelles involved in transduction of extra-cellular signals to the cell. This function requires the concentration of receptors and channels in the ciliary membrane, which is achieved by complex trafficking mechanisms, in part controlled by the small GTPase RAB8, and by sorting at the transition zone located at the entrance of the ciliary compartment. Mutations in the transition zone gene CC2D2A cause the related Joubert and Meckel syndromes, two typical ciliopathies characterized by central nervous system malformations, and result in loss of ciliary localization of multiple proteins in various models. The precise mechanisms by which CC2D2A and other transition zone proteins control protein entrance into the cilium and how they are linked to vesicular trafficking of incoming cargo remain largely unknown. In this work, we identify the centrosomal protein NINL as a physical interaction partner of CC2D2A. NINL partially co-localizes with CC2D2A at the base of cilia and ninl knockdown in zebrafish leads to photoreceptor outer segment loss, mislocalization of opsins and vesicle accumulation, similar to cc2d2a-/- phenotypes. Moreover, partial ninl knockdown in cc2d2a-/- embryos enhances the retinal phenotype of the mutants, indicating a genetic interaction in vivo, for which an illustration is found in patients from a Joubert Syndrome cohort. Similar to zebrafish cc2d2a mutants, ninl morphants display altered Rab8a localization. Further exploration of the NINL-associated interactome identifies MICAL3, a protein known to interact with Rab8 and to play an important role in vesicle docking and fusion. Together, these data support a model where CC2D2A associates with NINL to provide a docking point for cilia-directed cargo vesicles, suggesting a mechanism by which transition zone proteins can control the protein content of the ciliary compartment.},

Fusions of transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors of plant pathogenic Xanthomonas spp. to the FokI nuclease, TALENs bind and cleave DNA in pairs. Binding specificity is determined by customizable arrays of polymorphic amino acid repeats in the TAL effectors. We present a method and reagents for efficiently assembling TALEN constructs with custom repeat arrays. We also describe design guidelines based on naturally occurring TAL effectors and their binding sites. Using software that applies these guidelines, in nine genes from plants, animals and protists, we found candidate cleavage sites on average every 35 bp. Each of 15 sites selected from this set was cleaved in a yeast-based assay with TALEN pairs constructed with our reagents. We used two of the TALEN pairs to mutate HPRT1 in human cells and ADH1 in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. Our reagents include a plasmid construct for making custom TAL effectors and one for TAL effector fusions to additional proteins of interest. Using the former, we constructed de novo a functional analog of AvrHah1 of Xanthomonas gardneri.

abstract = {The small GTP-binding protein Rab8 is known to play an essential role in intracellular transport and cilia formation. We have previously demonstrated that Rab8a is required for localising apical markers in various organisms. Rab8a has a closely related isoform, Rab8b. To determine whether Rab8b can compensate for Rab8a, we generated Rab8b-knockout mice. Although the Rab8b-knockout mice did not display an overt phenotype, Rab8a and Rab8b double-knockout mice exhibited mislocalisation of apical markers and died earlier than Rab8a-knockout mice. The apical markers accumulated in three intracellular patterns in the double-knockout mice. However, the localisation of basolateral and/or dendritic markers of the double-knockout mice seemed normal. The morphology and the length of various primary and/or motile cilia, and the frequency of ciliated cells appeared to be identical in control and double-knockout mice. However, an additional knockdown of Rab10 in double-knockout cells greatly reduced the percentage of ciliated cells. Our results highlight the compensatory effect of Rab8a and Rab8b in apical transport, and the complexity of the apical transport process. In addition, neither Rab8a nor Rab8b are required for basolateral and/or dendritic transport. However, simultaneous loss of Rab8a and Rab8b has little effect on ciliogenesis, whereas additional loss of Rab10 greatly affects ciliogenesis.},

abstract = {Histone H3 is specifically phosphorylated during both mitosis and meiosis in patterns that are specifically coordinated in both space and time. Histone H3 phosphorylation may initiate at different phases of the cell division in different organisms, but metaphase chromosomes are always found to be heavily phosphorylated. Upon exit of mitosis/meiosis a global dephosphorylation of H3 takes place. Potential candidates for H3 kinases are described and their hypothetical mechanism of action on highly condensed chromatin templates is discussed. In addition, a novel hypothesis for the role of histone H3 phosphorylation during cell division is proposed. This hypothesis, termed the 'ready production label' model, explains the results in the literature and suggests that phosphorylation of histone H3 is a part of a complex signaling mechanism.},

abstract = {Studies on signalling dynamics in living embryos have been limited by a scarcity of in vivo reporters. Tandem fluorescent protein timers provide a generic method for detecting changes in protein population age and thus provide readouts for signalling events that lead to changes in protein stability or location. When imaged with quantitative dual-colour fluorescence microscopy, tandem timers offer detailed 'snapshot' readouts of signalling activity from subcellular to organismal scales, and therefore have the potential to revolutionize studies in developing embryos. Here we use computer modelling and embryo experiments to explore the behaviour of tandem timers in developing systems. We present a mathematical model of timer kinetics and provide software tools that will allow experimentalists to select the most appropriate timer designs for their biological question, and guide interpretation of the obtained readouts. Through the generation of a series of novel zebrafish reporter lines, we confirm experimentally that our quantitative model can accurately predict different timer responses in developing embryos and explain some less expected findings. For example, increasing the FRET efficiency of a tandem timer actually increases the ability of the timer to detect differences in protein half-life. Finally, while previous studies have used timers to monitor changes in protein turnover, our model shows that timers can also be used to facilitate the monitoring of gene expression kinetics in vivo.},

abstract = {The actin-binding protein Shroom is essential for neural tube morphogenesis in multiple vertebrate organisms, indicating its function is evolutionarily conserved. Shroom facilitates neurulation by regulating the morphology of neurepithelial cells. Shroom localizes to the apical tip of adherens junctions of neural ectoderm cells in vivo and to the apical junctional complex (AJC) in MDCK cells. Induced expression of Shroom in polarized epithelia elicits apical constriction and dramatic reorganization of the apical arrangement and packing of cells without altering apical-basal polarity. These events likely mimic the cell shape changes and cellular movements required for neurulation in vivo. The observed phenotypes depend on the ability of Shroom to alter F-actin distribution and regulate the formation of a previously uncharacterized contractile actomyosin network associated with the AJC. Targeting the C-terminal domain of Shroom to the apical plasma membrane elicits constriction and reorganization of the actomyosin network, indicting that this domain mediates Shroom's activity. In vivo, Shroom-mutant neural epithelia show a marked reduction in apically positioned myosin. Thus, Shroom likely facilitates neural tube closure by regulating cell shape changes via the apical positioning of an actomyosin network in the neurepithelium.},

@article{Harding2012,
abstract = {Many morphogenetic movements during development require the formation of transient intermediates called rosettes. Within rosettes, cells are polarized with apical ends constricted towards the rosette center and nuclei basally displaced. Whereas the polarity and cytoskeletal machinery establishing these structures has been extensively studied, the extracellular cues and intracellular signaling cascades that promote their formation are not well understood. We examined how extracellular Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signals regulate rosette formation in the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium (pLLp), a group of ∼100 cells that migrates along the trunk during embryonic development to form the lateral line mechanosensory system. During migration, the pLLp deposits rosettes from the trailing edge, while cells are polarized and incorporated into nascent rosettes in the leading region. Fgf signaling was previously shown to be crucial for rosette formation in the pLLp. We demonstrate that activation of Fgf receptor (Fgfr) induces intracellular Ras-MAPK, which is required for apical constriction and rosette formation in the pLLp. Inhibiting Fgfr-Ras-MAPK leads to loss of apically localized Rho-associated kinase (Rock) 2a, which results in failed actomyosin cytoskeleton activation. Using mosaic analyses, we show that a cell-autonomous Ras-MAPK signal is required for apical constriction and Rock2a localization. We propose a model whereby activated Fgfr signals through Ras-MAPK to induce apical localization of Rock2a in a cell-autonomous manner, activating the actomyosin network to promote apical constriction and rosette formation in the pLLp. This mechanism presents a novel cellular strategy for driving cell shape changes.},

abstract = {Primary cilia exert a profound impact on cell signalling and cell cycle progression. Recently, actin cytoskeleton destabilization has been recognized as a dominant inducer of ciliogenesis, but the exact mechanisms regulating ciliogenesis remain poorly understood. Here we show that the actin cytoskeleton remodelling controls ciliogenesis by regulating transcriptional coactivator YAP/TAZ as well as ciliary vesicle trafficking. Cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ correlates with active ciliogenesis either in spatially confined cells or in cells treated with an actin filament destabilizer. Moreover, knockdown of YAP/TAZ is sufficient to induce ciliogenesis, whereas YAP/TAZ hyperactivation suppresses serum starvation-mediated ciliogenesis. We also identify actin remodelling factors LIMK2 and TESK1 as key players in the ciliogenesis control network in which YAP/TAZ and directional vesicle trafficking are integral components. Our work provides new insights for understanding the link between actin dynamics and ciliogenesis.},

Thanks to its unique features, including large fecundity, embryo translucency, rapid and simultaneous development, etc., zebrafish embryos are often used for large scale toxicity assessment of chemicals and drug/compound screening. A typical screening procedure involves adult zebrafish spawning, embryos selection, and arraying the embryos into multi-well plates. From there, embryos are subjected to exposure and the toxicity of chemical, or the effectiveness of the drugs/compounds can be evaluated relatively quickly based on phenotypic observations. Among these processes, embryos arraying is one of the most time-consuming and labor-intensive steps that limits the throughput level. In this protocol, we present an innovative approach that makes use of a 3D-printed arraying template coupled with vacuum manipulation to speed up this laborious step. The protocol herein describes the overall design of the arraying template, a detailed experimental setup and step-by-step procedure, followed by representative results. When implemented, this approach should prove beneficial in a variety of research applications using zebrafish embryos as testing subjects.},

In this study, high-resolution SNP genotyping and exon-targeted array comparative genomic hybridization platforms were coupled to whole-exome sequencing to identify a novel disease candidate gene.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: SNP genotyping identified absence-of-heterozygosity regions in the heterotaxy proband on chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 13, 15, 18, consistent with parental consanguinity. Subsequently, whole-exome sequencing of the proband identified 26,065 coding variants, including 18 non-synonymous homozygous changes not present in dbSNP132 or 1000 Genomes. Of these 18, only 4--one each in CXCL2, SHROOM3, CTSO, RXFP1--were mapped to the absence-of-heterozygosity regions, each of which was flanked by more than 50 homozygous SNPs, confirming recessive segregation of mutant alleles. Sanger sequencing confirmed the SHROOM3 homozygous missense mutation and it was predicted as pathogenic by four bioinformatic tools. SHROOM3 has been identified as a central regulator of morphogenetic cell shape changes necessary for organogenesis and can physically bind ROCK2, a rho kinase protein required for left-right patterning. Screening 96 sporadic heterotaxy patients identified four additional patients with rare variants in SHROOM3.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Using whole exome sequencing, we identify a recessive missense mutation in SHROOM3 associated with heterotaxy syndrome and identify rare variants in subsequent screening of a heterotaxy cohort, suggesting SHROOM3 as a novel target for the control of left-right patterning.

abstract = {A cell embedded in a multicellular organism will experience a wide range of mechanical stimuli over the course of its life. Fluid flows and neighboring cells actively exert stresses on the cell, while the cell's environment presents a set of passive mechanical properties that constrain its physical behavior. Cells respond to these varied mechanical cues through biological responses that regulate activities such as differentiation, morphogenesis, and proliferation, as well as material responses involving compression, stretching, and relaxation. Here, we break down recent studies of mechanotransduction on the basis of the input mechanical stimuli acting upon the cell and the output response of the cell. This framework provides a useful starting point for identifying overlaps in molecular players and sensing modalities, and it highlights how different timescales involved in biological and material responses to mechanical inputs could serve as a means for filtering important mechanical signals from noise. ?? 2013 .},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The cell nucleus is a highly organized cellular organelle that contains the genetic material. The study of nuclear architecture has become an important field of cellular biology. Extracting quantitative data from 3D fluorescence imaging helps understand the functions of different nuclear compartments. However, such approaches are limited by the requirement for processing and analyzing large sets of images. RESULTS Here, we describe Tools for Analysis of Nuclear Genome Organization (TANGO), an image analysis tool dedicated to the study of nuclear architecture. TANGO is a coherent framework allowing biologists to perform the complete analysis process of 3D fluorescence images by combining two environments: ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) for image processing and quantitative analysis and R (http://cran.r-project.org) for statistical processing of measurement results. It includes an intuitive user interface providing the means to precisely build a segmentation procedure and set-up analyses, without possessing programming skills. TANGO is a versatile tool able to process large sets of images, allowing quantitative study of nuclear organization. AVAILABILITY TANGO is composed of two programs: (i) an ImageJ plug-in and (ii) a package (rtango) for R. They are both free and open source, available (http://biophysique.mnhn.fr/tango) for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OSX. Distribution is under the GPL v.2 licence.

abstract = {The Hippo pathway is crucial in organ size control, and its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. However, upstream signals that regulate the mammalian Hippo pathway have remained elusive. Here, we report that the Hippo pathway is regulated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Serum-borne lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphophate (S1P) act through G12/13-coupled receptors to inhibit the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2, thereby activating YAP and TAZ transcription coactivators, which are oncoproteins repressed by Lats1/2. YAP and TAZ are involved in LPA-induced gene expression, cell migration, and proliferation. In contrast, stimulation of Gs-coupled receptors by glucagon or epinephrine activates Lats1/2 kinase activity, thereby inhibiting YAP function. Thus, GPCR signaling can either activate or inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway depending on the coupled G protein. Our study identifies extracellular diffusible signals that modulate the Hippo pathway and also establishes the Hippo-YAP pathway as a critical signaling branch downstream of GPCR.},

abstract = {Oscillations of cytosolic free calcium levels have been shown to influence gene regulation and cell differ- entiation in a variety of model systems. Intercellular calcium waves thus present a plausible mechanism for coordinating cellular processes during embryogenesis. Herein we report use of aequorin and a photon imaging microscope to directly observe a rhythmic series of intercellular calcium waves that circumnavigate zebrafish embryos over a 10-h period during gastrulation and axial segmentation. These waves first ap- peared at about 65{\%} epiboly and continued to arise every 5–10 min up to at least the 16-somite stage. The waves originated from loci of high calcium activity bordering the blastoderm margin. Several initiating loci were active early in the wave series, whereas later a dorsal marginal midline locus predom- inated. On completion of epiboly, the dorsal locus was incor- porated into the developing tail bud and continued to generate calcium waves. The locations and timing at which calcium dynamics are most active appear to correspond closely to embryonic cellular and syncytial sites of known morphoge- netic importance. The observations suggest that a panembry- onic calcium signaling system operating in a clock-like fashion might play a role during vertebrate axial patterning.},

abstract = {The segmental plan of the Drosophila embryo is already established at the blastoderm stage through the action of maternal effect genes which determine the polarity of the embryo and zygotically active genes involved in segmentation. We have analyzed the first example of a group of maternally acting genes which are necessary for establishing the developmental potential of the posterior 25{\%} of the blastoderm. Females, homozygous for the X-linked maternal-effect mutation female sterile(1)Nasrat211 [fs(1)N211], produce embryos, characterized as torso-like, which lack all posterior endodermal derivatives as well as structures characteristic of abdominal segments 8 to 10. In addition, anterior endodermal derivatives are deficient and the absence of pharyngeal musculature causes a collapse of the cephalopharyngeal apparatus. The columnar blastoderm cell layer is defective at the posterior tip below the pole cells in these embryos. This defect, however, is presumably secondary to some abnormal feature of pole cell formation since in double mutants of fs(1)Nasrat211; tudor3 the blastoderm is normal but the embryos still show the torso-like phenotype. In situ hybridization with RNA probes derived from the fushi tarazu gene establishes that the cellular determination of the posterior blastoderm of embryos produced by fs(1)N211 is changed. This represents the first direct demonstration that a maternal-effect mutation alters the spatial distribution of a zygotic gene product involved in the segmental patterning of the embryo.},

Our approach uses an engineered version of EL222, a bacterial light-oxygen-voltage protein that binds DNA when illuminated with blue light. The system has a large ({\textgreater}100-fold) dynamic range of protein expression, rapid activation ({\textless}10 s) and deactivation kinetics ({\textless}50 s) and a highly linear response to light. With this system, we achieve light-gated transcription in several mammalian cell lines and intact zebrafish embryos with minimal basal gene activation and toxicity.

Despite the importance of this protein, little is known about the modalities by which it exerts such a large number of cellular functions. Here we show that a fraction of Foxg1 is localized within the mitochondria in cell lines, primary neuronal or glial cell cultures, and in the mouse cortex. Import of Foxg1 in isolated mitochondria appears to be membrane potential-dependent. Amino acids (aa) 277-302 were identified as critical for mitochondrial localization. Overexpression of full-length Foxg1 enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential ($\Delta$$\Psi$m) and promoted mitochondrial fission and mitosis. Conversely, overexpression of the C-term Foxg1 (aa 272-481), which is selectively localized in the mitochondrial matrix, enhanced organelle fusion and promoted the early phase of neuronal differentiation. These findings suggest that the different subcellular localizations of Foxg1 control the machinery that brings about cell differentiation, replication, and bioenergetics, possibly linking mitochondrial functions to embryonic development and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {To help understand mechanisms of vertebrate genome evolution, we have compared zebrafish and tetrapod gene maps. It has been suggested that translocations are fixed more frequently than inversions in mammals. Gene maps showed that blocks of conserved syntenies between zebrafish and humans were large, but gene orders were frequently inverted and transposed. This shows that intrachromosomal rearrangements have been fixed more frequently than translocations. Duplicated chromosome segments suggest that a genome duplication occurred in ray-fin phylogeny, and comparative studies suggest that this event happened deep in the ancestry of teleost fish. Consideration of duplicate chromosome segments shows that at least 20{\%} of duplicated gene pairs may be retained from this event. Despite genome duplication, zebrafish and humans have about the same number of chromosomes, and zebrafish chromosomes are mosaically orthologous to several human chromosomes. Is this because of an excess of chromosome fissions in the human lineage or an excess of chromosome fusions in the zebrafish lineage? Comparative analysis suggests that an excess of chromosome fissions in the tetrapod lineage may account for chromosome numbers and provides histories for several human chromosomes.},

abstract = {To gain insights into the cellular mechanisms of neurogenesis, we analyzed retinal neuroepithelia deficient for Llgl1, a protein implicated in apicobasal cell polarity, asymmetric cell division, cell shape and cell cycle exit. We found that vertebrate retinal neuroepithelia deficient for Llgl1 retained overt apicobasal polarity, but had expanded apical domains. Llgl1 retinal progenitors also had increased Notch activity and reduced rates of neurogenesis. Blocking Notch function by depleting Rbpj restored normal neurogenesis. Experimental expansion of the apical domain, through inhibition of Shroom3, also increased Notch activity and reduced neurogenesis. Significantly, in wild-type retina, neurogenic retinal progenitors had smaller apical domains compared with proliferative neuroepithelia. As nuclear position during interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM) has been previously linked with cell cycle exit, we analyzed this phenomenon in cells depleted of Llgl1. We found that although IKNM was normal, the relationship between nuclear position and neurogenesis was shifted away from the apical surface, consistent with increased pro-proliferative and/or anti-neurogenic signals associated with the apical domain. These data, in conjunction with other findings, suggest that, in retinal neuroepithelia, the size of the apical domain modulates the strength of polarized signals that influence neurogenesis.},

abstract = {The Hippo signaling pathway emerged from studies of Drosophila tumor suppressor genes, and is now appreciated as a major growth control pathway in vertebrates as well as arthropods. As a recently discovered pathway, key components of the pathway are continually being identified, and new insights into how the pathway is regulated and deployed are arising at a rapid pace. Over the past year and a half, significant advances have been made in our understanding of upstream regulatory inputs into Hippo signaling, key negative regulators of Hippo pathway activity have been identified, and important roles for the pathway in regeneration have been described. This review describes these and other advances, focusing on recent progress in our understanding of Hippo signaling that has come from continued studies in Drosophila.},

There is no doubt that the possibility of culturing microglia in vitro has advanced enormously our understanding of these cells. However, as we know today, that microglia react to even small changes in the brain, it is crucial to also study these cells by preserving as much as possible their natural environment. Nowadays, advances in imaging technologies and transgenic cell labeling methods allow the direct observation of cells at work. These in vivo approaches have already changed our view on microglia by showing that these cells are active even in the healthy adult brain. As today, there is upcoming evidence that microglia can directly influence neuronal activity, understanding their roles and, in particular, their interactions with neurons is of great importance. The aim of this review is to illustrate three animal models that are currently used for microglial research and to discuss their characteristics and advantages by presenting recent achievements in microglial research. In our view the availability of different systems for studying microglia will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of their functions.},

abstract = {Understanding the cellular and mechanical processes that underlie the shape changes of individual cells and their collective behaviors in a tissue during dynamic and complex morphogenetic events is currently one of the major frontiers in developmental biology. The advent of high-speed time-lapse microscopy and its use in monitoring the cellular events in fluorescently labeled developing organisms demonstrate tremendous promise in establishing detailed descriptions of these events and could potentially provide a foundation for subsequent hypothesis-driven research strategies. However, obtaining quantitative measurements of dynamic shapes and behaviors of cells and tissues in a rapidly developing metazoan embryo using time-lapse 3D microscopy remains technically challenging, with the main hurdle being the shortage of robust imaging processing and analysis tools. We have developed EDGE4D, a software tool for segmenting and tracking membrane-labeled cells using multi-photon microscopy data. Our results demonstrate that EDGE4D enables quantification of the dynamics of cell shape changes, cell interfaces and neighbor relations at single-cell resolution during a complex epithelial folding event in the early Drosophila embryo. We expect this tool to be broadly useful for the analysis of epithelial cell geometries and movements in a wide variety of developmental contexts.},

@article{Haigo2003,
abstract = {Background: The morphogenetic events of early vertebrate development generally involve the combined actions of several populations of cells, each engaged in a distinct behavior. Neural tube closure, for instance, involves apicobasal cell heightening, apical constriction at hingepoints, convergent extension of the midline, and pushing by the epidermis. Although a large number of genes are known to be required for neural tube closure, in only a very few cases has the affected cell behavior been identified. For example, neural tube closure requires the actin binding protein Shroom, but the cellular basis of Shroom function and how it influences neural tube closure remain to be elucidated. Results: We show here that expression of Shroom is sufficient to organize apical constriction in transcriptionally quiescent, naive epithelial cells but not in non-polarized cells. Shroom-induced apical constriction was associated with enrichment of apically localized actin filaments and required the small GTPase Rap1 but not Rho. Endogenous Xenopus shroom was found to be expressed in cells engaged in apical constriction. Consistent with a role for Shroom in organizing apical constriction, disrupting Shroom function resulted in a specific failure of hingepoint formation, defective neuroepithelial sheet-bending, and failure of neural tube closure. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that Shroom is an essential regulator of apical constriction during neurulation. The finding that a single protein can initiate this process in epithelial cells establishes that bending of epithelial sheets may be patterned during development by the regulation of expression of single genes.},

abstract = {Wnt-signalling is involved in a number of biological processes in the course of embryonic development, cell fate determination, proliferation, stem cell maintenance and oncogenesis. Wnt ligands are secreted glycoproteins and the number of Wnt isoforms varies between five in nematodes and 27 in fish. The highly conserved group of Wnt7 genes has been found to signal via at least three Wnt-signalling pathways dependent on the developmental context. These ligands have been identified as important regulators in a number of processes ranging from formation of bones, lungs, kidneys, reproductive organs and placenta to vasculogenesis and synaptogenesis in the brain. The importance of Wnt7 function is underscored by their implication in disease syndromes in man. Unlike the single Wnt7a and Wnt7b mammalian genes we find that the zebrafish genome contains two paralogues genes for each Wnt7 ligand. Here, we compare these four Wnt7 genes evolutionarily and analyse their expression during the first two days of embryonic development. We find Wnt7 genes mainly expressed in a number of CNS structures at developmental stages at which patterning and neural specification takes place. The timely and spatially overlapping as well as complementary gene expression suggests diverse as well as redundant involvements during brain development.},

abstract = {The highly conserved Notch signalling pathway functions in many different developmental and homeostatic processes, which raises the question of how this pathway can achieve such diverse outcomes. With a direct route from the membrane to the nucleus, the Notch pathway has fewer opportunities for regulation than do many other signalling pathways, yet it generates exquisitely patterned structures, including sensory hair cells and branched arterial networks. More confusingly, its activity promotes tissue growth and cancers in some circumstances but cell death and tumour suppression in others. Many different regulatory mechanisms help to shape the activity of the Notch pathway, generating functional outputs that are appropriate for each context. These mechanisms include the receptor-ligand landscape, the tissue topology, the nuclear environment and the connectivity of the regulatory networks.},

abstract = {Dysfunctional cilia underlie a broad range of cellular and tissue phenotypes and can eventually result in the development of ciliopathies: pathologically diverse diseases that range from clinically mild to highly complex and severe multi-organ failure syndromes incompatible with neonatal life. Given that virtually all cells of the human body have the capacity to generate cilia, it is likely that clinical manifestations attributed to ciliary dysfunction will increase in the years to come. Disputed but nevertheless enigmatic is the notion that at least a subset of tumor phenotypes fit within the ciliopathy disease spectrum and that cilia loss may be required for tumor progression. Contending for the centrosome renders ciliation and cell division mutually exclusive; a regulated tipping of balance promotes either process. The mechanisms involved, however, are complex. If the hypothesis that tumorigenesis results from dysfunctional cilia is true, then why do the classic ciliopathies only show limited hyperplasia at best? Although disassembly of the cilium is a prerequisite for cell proliferation, it does not intrinsically drive tumorigenesis per se. Alternatively, we will explore the emerging evidence suggesting that some tumors depend on ciliary signaling. After reviewing the structure, genesis and signaling of cilia, the various ciliopathy syndromes and their genetics, we discuss the current debate of tumorigenesis as a ciliopathy spectrum defect, and describe recent advances in this fascinating field.},

abstract = {Cilia and basal bodies are essential organelles for a broad spectrum of functions, including the development of left-right asymmetry, kidney function, cerebrospinal fluid transport, generation of photoreceptor outer segments, and hedgehog signaling. Zebrafish fleer (flr) mutants exhibit kidney cysts, randomized left-right asymmetry, hydrocephalus, and rod outer segment defects, suggesting a pleiotropic defect in ciliogenesis. Positional cloning flr identified a tetratricopeptide repeat protein homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein DYF1 that was highly expressed in ciliated cells. flr pronephric cilia were shortened and showed a reduced beat amplitude, and olfactory cilia were absent in mutants. flr cilia exhibited ultrastructural defects in microtubule B-tubules, similar to axonemes that lack tubulin posttranslational modifications (polyglutamylation or polyglycylation). flr cilia showed a dramatic reduction in cilia polyglutamylated tubulin, indicating that flr encodes a novel modulator of tubulin polyglutamylation. We also found that the C. elegans flr homologue, dyf-1, is also required for tubulin polyglutamylation in sensory neuron cilia. Knockdown of zebrafish Ttll6, a tubulin polyglutamylase, specifically eliminated tubulin polyglutamylation and cilia formation in olfactory placodes, similar to flr mutants. These results are the first in vivo evidence that tubulin polyglutamylation is required for vertebrate cilia motility and structure, and, when compromised, results in failed ciliogenesis.

abstract = {Apical constriction (AC) is a widely utilized mechanism of cell shape change whereby epithelial cells transform from a cylindrical to conical shape, which can facilitate morphogenetic movements during embryonic development. Invertebrate epithelial cells undergoing AC depend on the contraction of apical cortex-spanning actomyosin filaments that generate force on the apical junctions and pull them toward the middle of the cell, effectively reducing the apical circumference. A current challenge is to determine whether these mechanisms are conserved in vertebrates and to identify the molecules responsible for linking apical junctions with the AC machinery. Utilizing the developing mouse eye as a model, we have uncovered evidence that lens placode AC may be partially dependent on apically positioned myosin-containing filaments associated with the zonula adherens. In addition we found that, among several junctional components, p120-catenin genetically interacts with Shroom3, a protein required for AC during embryonic morphogenesis. Further analysis revealed that, similar to Shroom3, p120-catenin is required for AC of lens cells. Finally, we determined that p120-catenin functions by recruiting Shroom3 to adherens junctions. Together, these data identify a novel role for p120-catenin during AC and further define the mechanisms required for vertebrate AC. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {The evolutionarily conserved Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for correct embryogenesis and is misregulated in several malignancies. In cell culture, Hh-sensitive cells display a striking dependence on cell density with active Hh signaling requiring cell-to-cell contact. As the Hippo/YAP system is tightly linked to cell density control and contact inhibition, we investigated the cross-talk between the two pathways. Our data reveal that the suppression of Hh signaling in the absence of cellular contacts is independent of primary cilia and is mediated by the YAP oncogene. Overexpression of YAP blocks Hh signaling whereas RNA interference-mediated knockdown of YAP enhances Hh/GLI activity. Despite this negative regulation, Hh signaling promotes YAP activity through post-transcriptional mechanisms, resulting in a negative feedback loop. In vivo, we found strong nuclear YAP immunoreactivity restricted to compartments with low Hh pathway activity in human and mouse pancreatic cancer. Finally, we identified protease-activated receptors (PARs) as molecules being able to override the inverse Hippo/Hh regulation, potentially giving tumors a mechanism to utilize both oncogenic pathways in parallel.Oncogenesis (2014) 3, e112; doi:10.1038/oncsis.2014.27; published online 11 August 2014.},

abstract = {Vertebrate left-right (LR) asymmetry originates at a transient left-right organizer (LRO), where cilia play a crucial role in breaking symmetry. The LRO is a ciliated structure, however, much remains unknown about the choreography of cilia biogenesis and resorption at this organ. We recently identified a mutation affecting NEK2, a member of the NIMA-like serine-threonine kinase family, in a patient with congenital heart disease associated with abnormal LR development. Here, we report how Nek2 acts through cilia to influence LR patterning. Both overexpression and knockdown of nek2 in Xenopus result in abnormal LR development and reduction of LRO cilia count and motility, phenotypes that are modified by interaction with the Hippo signaling pathway. nek2 knockdown leads to a centriole defect at the LRO, consistent with the known role of Nek2 in centriole separation. Nek2 overexpression results in premature ciliary resorption in cultured cells dependent on function of the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6. Finally, we provide evidence that the known interaction between Nek2 and Nup98, a nucleoporin that localizes to the ciliary base, is important for regulating cilium resorption. Together these data show that Nek2 is a switch balancing ciliogenesis and resorption in the development of LR asymmetry.},

We isolated 525 mutants, representing lesions in approximately 390 different genes, and we cloned the majority of these. Here we describe 315 mutants and the corresponding genes. Our data suggest that there are roughly 1,400 embryonic-essential genes in the fish. Thus, we have mutations in approximately 25{\%} of these genes and have cloned approximately 22{\%} of them. Re-screens of our collection to identify mutants with specific developmental defects suggest that approximately 50 genes are essential for the development of some individual organs or cell types. Seventy-two percent of the embryonic-essential fish genes have homologues in yeast, 93{\%} have homologues in invertebrates (fly or worm), and 99{\%} have homologues in human. Yeast and worm orthologues of genes that are essential for early zebrafish development have a strong tendency to be essential for viability in yeast and for embryonic development in the worm. Thus, the trait of being a genetically essential gene is conserved in evolution. This mutant collection should be a valuable resource for diverse studies of cell and developmental biology.},

To investigate the functional relevance of lncRNAs in various physiological conditions, we have developed a collection of 18 lncRNA knockout strains in which the locus is maintained transcriptionally active. Initial characterization revealed peri- and postnatal lethal phenotypes in three mutant strains (Fendrr, Peril, and Mdgt), the latter two exhibiting incomplete penetrance and growth defects in survivors. We also report growth defects for two additional mutant strains (linc-Brn1b and linc-Pint). Further analysis revealed defects in lung, gastrointestinal tract, and heart in Fendrr(-/-) neonates, whereas linc-Brn1b(-/-) mutants displayed distinct abnormalities in the generation of upper layer II-IV neurons in the neocortex. This study demonstrates that lncRNAs play critical roles in vivo and provides a framework and impetus for future larger-scale functional investigation into the roles of lncRNA molecules.

Novel microscope technologies allow the imaging of developmental processes in unprecedented detail, and they enable the use of complex image-based read-outs for high-throughput/high-content screening. Such applications can easily generate Terabytes of image data, the handling and analysis of which becomes a major bottleneck in extracting the targeted information. Here, we describe the current state of the art in computational image analysis in the zebrafish system. We discuss the challenges encountered when handling high-content image data, especially with regard to data quality, annotation, and storage. We survey methods for preprocessing image data for further analysis, and describe selected examples of automated image analysis, including the tracking of cells during embryogenesis, heartbeat detection, identification of dead embryos, recognition of tissues and anatomical landmarks, and quantification of behavioral patterns of adult fish. We review recent examples for applications using such methods, such as the comprehensive analysis of cell lineages during early development, the generation of a three-dimensional brain atlas of zebrafish larvae, and high-throughput drug screens based on movement patterns. Finally, we identify future challenges for the zebrafish image analysis community, notably those concerning the compatibility of algorithms and data formats for the assembly of modular analysis pipelines.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of biological tissues are increasingly recognized as important in developmental and pathological processes. Most existing mechanical measurement techniques either necessitate destruction of the tissue for access or provide insufficient spatial resolution. Here, we show for the first time a systematic application of confocal Brillouin microscopy to quantitatively map the mechanical properties of spinal cord tissues during biologically relevant processes in a contact-free and non-destructive manner. Living zebrafish larvae were mechanically imaged in all anatomical planes, during development and after spinal cord injury. These experiments revealed that Brillouin microscopy is capable of detecting the mechanical properties of distinct anatomical structures without interfering with the animal's natural development. The Brillouin shift within the spinal cord increased during development and transiently decreased during the repair processes following spinal cord transection. These results show that the larval zebrafish spinal cord tissue presents mechanical signals for mechanosensitive cells residing in the tissue. The work presented constitutes the first step towards an in vivo assessment of spinal cord tissue mechanics during regeneration, provides a methodical basis to identify key determinants of mechanical tissue properties and allows to test their relative importance in combination with biochemical and genetic factors during developmental and regenerative processes.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial growth in research into how changes in the biomechanical and biophysical properties of cells and subcellular structures influence, and are influenced by, the onset and progression of human diseases. This paper presents an overview of the rapidly expanding, nascent field of research that deals with the biomechanics and biophysics of cancer cells. The review begins with some key observations on the biology of cancer cells and on the role of actin microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubule biopolymer cytoskeletal components in influencing cell mechanics, locomotion, differentiation and neoplastic transformation. In order to set the scene for mechanistic discussions of the connections among alterations to subcellular structures, attendant changes in cell deformability, cytoadherence, migration, invasion and tumor metastasis, a survey is presented of the various quantitative mechanical and physical assays to extract the elastic and viscoelastic deformability of cancer cells. Results available in the literature on cell mechanics for different types of cancer are then reviewed. Representative case studies are presented next to illustrate how chemically induced cytoskeletal changes, biomechanical responses and signals from the intracellular regions act in concert with the chemomechanical environment of the extracellular matrix and the molecular tumorigenic signaling pathways to effect malignant transformations. Results are presented to illustrate how changes to cytoskeletal architecture induced by cancer drugs and chemotherapy regimens can significantly influence cell mechanics and disease state. It is reasoned through experimental evidence that greater understanding of the mechanics of cancer cell deformability and its interactions with the extracellular physical, chemical and biological environments offers enormous potential for significant new developments in disease diagnostics, prophylactics, therapeutics and drug efficacy assays. {\textcopyright} 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {During embryonic development, pattern formation must be tightly synchronized with tissue morphogenesis to coordinate the establishment of the spatial identities of cells with their movements. In the vertebrate retina, patterning along the dorsal-ventral and nasal-temporal (anterior-posterior) axes is required for correct spatial representation in the retinotectal map. However, it is unknown how specification of axial cell positions in the retina occurs during the complex process of early eye morphogenesis. Studying zebrafish embryos, we show that morphogenetic tissue rearrangements during eye evagination result in progenitor cells in the nasal half of the retina primordium being brought into proximity to the sources of three fibroblast growth factors, Fgf8/3/24, outside the eye. Triple-mutant analysis shows that this combined Fgf signal fully controls nasal retina identity by regulating the nasal transcription factor Foxg1. Surprisingly, nasal-temporal axis specification occurs very early along the dorsal-ventral axis of the evaginating eye. By in vivo imaging GFP-tagged retinal progenitor cells, we find that subsequent eye morphogenesis requires gradual tissue compaction in the nasal half and directed cell movements into the temporal half of the retina. Balancing these processes drives the progressive alignment of the nasal-temporal retina axis with the anterior-posterior body axis and is controlled by a feed-forward effect of Fgf signaling on Foxg1-mediated cell cohesion. Thus, the mechanistic coupling and dynamic synchronization of tissue patterning with morphogenetic cell behavior through Fgf signaling leads to the graded allocation of cell positional identity in the eye, underlying retinotectal map formation.},

abstract = {The cortex is a thin, crosslinked actin network lying immediately beneath the plasma membrane of animal cells. Myosin motors exert contractile forces in the meshwork. Because the cortex is attached to the cell membrane, it plays a central role in cell shape control. The proteic constituents of the cortex undergo rapid turnover, making the cortex both mechanically rigid and highly plastic, two properties essential to its function. The cortex has recently attracted increasing attention and its functions in cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell migration, and embryogenesis are progressively being dissected. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the structural organization, composition, and mechanics of the actin cortex, focusing on the link between molecular processes and macroscopic physical properties. We also highlight consequences of cortex dysfunction in disease. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an important aprotic solvent that can solubilize a wide variety of otherwise poorly soluble polar and nonpolar molecules. This, coupled with its apparent low toxicity at concentrations {\textless}10{\%}, has led to its ubiquitous use and widespread application. Here, we demonstrate that DMSO induces retinal apoptosis in vivo at low concentrations (5 $\mu$l intravitreally dosed DMSO in rat from a stock concentration of 1, 2, 4, and 8{\%} v/v). Toxicity was confirmed in vitro in a retinal neuronal cell line, at DMSO concentrations {\textgreater}1{\%} (v/v), using annexin V, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and AlamarBlue cell viability assays. DMSO concentrations {\textgreater}10{\%} (v/v) have recently been reported to cause cellular toxicity through plasma membrane pore formation. Here, we show the mechanism by which low concentrations (2-4{\%} DMSO) induce caspase-3 independent neuronal death that involves apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from mitochondria to the nucleus and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) activation. These results highlight safety concerns of using low concentrations of DMSO as a solvent for in vivo administration and in biological assays. We recommend that methods other than DMSO are employed for solubilizing drugs but, where no alternative exists, researchers compute absolute DMSO final concentrations and include an untreated control group in addition to DMSO vehicle control to check for solvent toxicity.},

In our method, PCR-amplified sequence of a gene of interest is used as a template for the synthesis of an antisense RNA probe, which is labeled with digoxigenin-linked nucleotides. Embryos are fixed and permeabilized before being soaked in the digoxigenin-labeled probe. We use conditions that favor specific hybridization to complementary mRNA sequences in the tissue(s) expressing the corresponding gene. After washing away excess probe, hybrids are detected by immunohistochemistry using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody against digoxigenin and a chromogenic substrate. The whole procedure takes only 3 days and, because ISH conditions are the same for each probe tested, allows high throughput analysis of zebrafish gene expression during embryogenesis.},

In recent times, there has been a renewed interest in understanding the induction and differentiation of these deceptively simple ectodermal regions. This has led to a wealth of information on the molecular cues governing these processes.

abstract = {The ophthalmic trigeminal (opV) placode exclusively gives rise to sensory neurons, making it a good model to study the molecular regulation of sensory neurogenesis. A number of signaling pathways including Wnt, PDGF, FGF, and Notch have been shown to be involved in the process of opV placode cell development. However, the regulatory relationships between these signaling pathways in placode cells are still unknown and have been difficult to study experimentally. Using a novel multifactorial approach in chick embryos that allows for inhibition of FGF throughout the tissue or in individual cells, with simultaneous inactivation of Notch signaling, we investigated the potential interaction between the FGF and Notch signaling pathways in trigeminal sensory neurogenesis. This study builds on prior research describing the individual role of FGF signaling or Notch signaling in opV placode development, where blocking FGF signaling resulted in neurogenesis failure, while blocking Notch signaling resulted in enhanced neurogenesis. Reported here, blocking both pathways simultaneously resulted in a reduction in the number of cells delaminating from the opV placode and undergoing sensory neuron differentiation. Further, Notch inhibition alone did not lead to an increase in the number of cells expressing FGFR4 or in the FGFR4 expression domain, but did result in a highly fragmented basal lamina, which was reversed when blocking FGF signaling. Cumulatively, the results presented here do not support a model of Notch/FGF interdependence, rather that FGF and Notch act in parallel to promote sensory neurogenesis.},

abstract = {Coordinating exit from the cell cycle with differentiation is critical for proper development and tissue homeostasis. Failure to do so can lead to aberrant organogenesis and tumorigenesis. However, little is known about the developmental signals that regulate the cell cycle exit-to-differentiation switch. Signals downstream of two key developmental pathways, Notch and Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH), and of myosin activity regulate this switch during the development of the follicle cell epithelium of the Drosophila ovary. Here, we have identified a fourth player, the integrin signaling pathway. We find that elimination of integrin function blocks mitosis-to-endocycle switch and differentiation in posterior follicle cells (PFCs), via regulation of the CDK inhibitor dacapo. In addition, we show that integrin mutant PFCs show defective Notch signalling and endocytosis. Furthermore, integrins act in PFCs by modulating the activity of the Notch pathway, as reducing the amount of Hairless, the major antagonist of Notch, or misexpressing Notch intracellular domain rescues the cell cycle and differentiation defects. Altogether, our findings reveal a direct involvement of integrin signalling on the spatial and temporal regulation of epithelial cell differentiation during development.},

abstract = {Themammalian heart regenerates poorly, and damage commonly leads to heart failure. Hippo signaling is an evolutionarily conserved kinase cascade that regulates organ size during development and prevents adultmammalian cardiomyocyte regeneration by inhibiting the transcriptional coactivator Yap, which also responds to mechanical signaling in cultured cells to promote cell proliferation. To identify Yap target genes that are activated during cardiomyocyte renewal and regeneration, we performed Yap chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and mRNA expression profiling in Hippo signaling–deficient mouse hearts. We found that Yap directly regulated genes encoding cell cycle progression proteins, as well as genes encoding proteins that promote F-actin polymerization and that link the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Included in the latter group were components of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, a large molecular complex that, when defective, results in muscular dystrophy in humans. Car- diomyocytes near the scar tissue of injured Hippo signaling–deficient mouse hearts showed cellular pro- trusions suggestive of cytoskeletal remodeling. The hearts of mdx mutant mice, which lack functional dystrophin and are a model for muscular dystrophy, showed impaired regeneration and cytoskeleton re- modeling, but normal cardiomyocyte proliferation, after injury. Our data showed that, in addition to genes encoding cell cycle progression proteins, Yap regulated genes that enhance cytoskeletal remodeling. Thus, blocking the Hippo pathway input to Yap may tip the balance so that Yap responds to mechanical changes associated with heart injury to promote repair.},

Recent advances in molecular and experimental techniques, easy maintenance and breeding, and the fast, synchronous and stereotypical development have facilitated the establishment of Platynereis as one of the leading model species in the eco-evo-devo field. Most importantly, Platynereis allows the combination of expression profiling, morphological and physiological characterization at the single cell level. Here, we discuss recent advances in the collection of -omics data for the lab strain and for natural populations collected world-wide that can be integrated with population-specific cellular analyses to result in a cellular atlas integrating genetic, phenotypic and ecological variation.

Cell shape changes and tissue movements like these are at the core of many of the morphogenetic movements that shape animal form during development, driving processes such as gastrulation, tube formation, and neurulation. The mechanisms of such cell shape changes must integrate developmental patterning information in order to spatially and temporally control force production-issues that touch on fundamental aspects of both cell and developmental biology and on birth defects research. How does developmental patterning regulate force-producing mechanisms, and what roles do such mechanisms play in development? Work on apical constriction from multiple systems including Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, sea urchin, Xenopus, chick, and mouse has begun to illuminate these issues. Here, we review this effort to explore the diversity of mechanisms of apical constriction, the diversity of roles that apical constriction plays in development, and the common themes that emerge from comparing systems. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Such less apparent manifestations of phototoxicity are equally problematic, and can change the conclusions drawn from an experiment. Thus, limiting phototoxicity is a prerequisite for obtaining reproducible quantitative data on biological processes. We present strategies to reduce phototoxicity, e.g. limiting the illumination to the focal plane and suggest controls for phototoxicity effects. Overall, we argue that phototoxicity needs increased attention from researchers when designing experiments, and when evaluating research findings.},

We observed fast transitions between different conductance levels reflecting opening and closing of metastable lipid pores. Although mean lifetime of the pores was 3 +/- 0.8 ms (250 mV), some pores remained open for up to approximately 1 s. The mean amplitude of conductance fluctuations (approximately 500 pS) was independent of voltage and close for bilayers of different area (40,000 and 10 microm(2)), indicating the local nature of the conductive defects. The distribution of pore conductance was rather broad (dispersion of approximately 250 pS). Based on the conductance value and its dependence of the ion size, the radius of the average pore was estimated as approximately 1 nm. Short bursts of conductance spikes (opening and closing of pores) were often separated by periods of background conductance. Within the same burst the conductance between spikes was indistinguishable from the background. The mean time interval between spikes in the burst was much smaller than that between adjacent bursts. These data indicate that opening and closing of lipidic pores proceed through some electrically invisible (silent) pre-pores. Similar pre-pore defects and metastable conductive pores might be involved in remodeling of cell membranes in different biologically relevant processes.},

In addition to Rho, Rac and Cdc42, which are well known to regulate migration, I discuss the roles of other less-well characterized members of the Rho family.},

@article{Zalewski2016,
abstract = {Shroom-mediated remodeling of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is a critical driver of cellular shape and tissue morphology that underlies the development of many tissues, including the neural tube, eye, intestines, and vasculature. Shroom uses a conserved SD2 domain to direct the subcellular localization of Rho-kinase (Rock) which in turn drives changes in the cytoskeleton and cellular morphology through its ability to phosphorylate and activate non-muscle myosin II. Here, we present the structure of the human Shroom-Rock binding module, revealing an unexpected stoichiometry for Shrm in which two Shrm SD2 domains bind independent surfaces on Rock. Mutation of interfacial residues impaired Shroom-Rock binding in vitro, and resulted in altered remodeling of the cytoskeleton and loss of Shroom-mediated changes in cellular morphology. Additionally, we provide the first direct evidence that Shroom can function as a Rock activator. These data provide molecular insight into the Shroom-Rock interface and demonstrate that Shroom directly participates in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, adding to its known role in Rock localization.},

The mammalian genome is extensively transcribed, giving rise to thousands of non-coding transcripts.

Recent studies have begun to explore the functional diversity and mechanistic role of these large ncRNAs. Here we synthesize these studies to provide an emerging model whereby large ncRNAs might achieve regulatory specificity through modularity, assembling diverse combinations of proteins and possibly RNA and DNA interactions.},

abstract = {In vivo, cells respond to a host of physical cues ranging from substrate stiffness to the organization of micro- and nanoscale fibrous networks. We show that macroscale substrates with radii of curvature from tens to hundreds of micrometers influence cell alignment. In a model system of fibroblasts, isolated cells aligned strongly in the axial direction on cylinders with radii similar to the cell length and more weakly on cylinders of much larger radius. Isolated vascular smooth muscle cells did not align as effectively as fibroblasts. However, both cell types aligned robustly in weak curvature fields when in confluent monolayers. We identified two distinct populations of stress fibers in both cell types: long, apical stress fibers that aligned axially and short, basal stress fibers that aligned circumferentially. Circumferential alignment of the basal stress fibers is in apparent disagreement with a long-standing hypothesis that energetic penalties for bending enforce axial alignment on cylinders. To explore this phenomenon, we manipulated stress fibers by activating Rho, a small guanosine triphosphatase that regulates stress fiber assembly. In response, apical stress fibers disassembled, whereas basal stress fibers thickened and aligned more strongly in the circumferential direction. By activating Rho in confluent monolayers of vascular smooth muscle cells, we recapitulated the circumferential alignment pattern of F-actin within these cells that is observed in cylindrical vessels in vivo. In agreement with recent theory, these results suggest that stress fiber bending penalties are overcome when stress fiber contractility is enhanced and motivate deeper study of the mechanics of these distinct stress fiber populations.},

abstract = {To generate stable lines of transgenic fish, early zebrafish embryos were injected with high concentrations of a linear bacterial plasmid. After injection, the foreign DNA was converted into a high molecular weight form and then amplified approximately tenfold during the initial rapid cleavages characteristic of the early embryo prior to gastrulation. While most of this DNA was subsequently degraded during gastrulation, some of the foreign sequences survived the gastrula stage and could be found in most of the injected fish at 3 weeks of age. Only about 5{\%} of fish analysed 4 months after the injection retained foreign DNA in their fins, usually at less than one copy per cell. One of these fish was also found to contain about 100 copies per cell of foreign DNA in a fraction of its germ cells. Approximately 20{\%} of the F1 offspring from this germ-line-positive parent inherited the foreign DNA, whereas 50{\%} of F2 progeny obtained from an identified F1 individual inherited these sequences. The 50{\%} transmission rate in F2 progeny was as expected for a single, heterozygous genomic insert. These observations indicate that injected DNA can be integrated into the fish genome, that the resulting transgenic fish are mosaic and that some of these mosaic individuals give rise to stable lines of transgenic fish.},

Little is known about how these forces shape embryonic organs, mainly because it has not been possible to measure cellular forces within developing three-dimensional (3D) tissues in vivo. We present a method to quantify cell-generated mechanical stresses exerted locally within living embryonic tissues, using fluorescent, cell-sized oil microdroplets with defined mechanical properties and coated with adhesion receptor ligands. After a droplet is introduced between cells in a tissue, local stresses are determined from droplet shape deformations, measured using fluorescence microscopy and computerized image analysis. Using this method, we quantified the anisotropic stresses generated by mammary epithelial cells cultured within 3D aggregates, and we confirmed that these stresses (3.4 nN $\mu$m(-2)) are dependent on myosin II activity and are more than twofold larger than stresses generated by cells of embryonic tooth mesenchyme, either within cultured aggregates or in developing whole mouse mandibles.},

RNA sequences that cross-link with a given protein are isolated by immunoprecipitation of the protein, and reversal of the formaldehyde cross-linking permits recovery and quantitative analysis of the immunoprecipitated RNA by reverse transcription PCR. The basics of RIP are very similar to those of ChIP, but with some important caveats. This unit describes the RIP procedure for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the corresponding steps for metazoan cells have not yet been worked out, it is likely that the yeast procedure can easily be adapted for use in other organisms.},

abstract = {In addition to their ubiquitous apical-basal polarity, many epithelia are also polarized along an orthogonal axis, a phenomenon termed planar cell polarity (PCP). In the mammalian inner ear and the zebrafish lateral line, PCP is revealed through the orientation of mechanosensitive hair cells relative to each other and to the body axes. In each neuromast, the receptor organ of the lateral line, hair bundles are arranged in a mirror-symmetrical fashion. Here we show that the establishment of mirror symmetry is preceded by rotational rearrangements between hair-cell pairs, a behavior consistently associated with the division of hair-cell precursors. Time-lapse imaging of trilobite mutants, which lack the core PCP constituent Vang-like protein 2 (Vangl2), shows that their misoriented hair cells correlate with misaligned divisions of hair-cell precursors and an inability to complete rearrangements accurately. Vangl2 is asymmetrically localized in the cells of the neuromast, a configuration required for accurate completion of rearrangements. Manipulation of Vangl2 expression or of Notch signaling results in a uniform hair-cell polarity, indicating that rearrangements refine neuromast polarity with respect to the body axes.},

abstract = {Transgenic lines carrying fluorescent reporter genes like GFP have been of great value in the elucidation of developmental features and physiological processes in various animal models, including zebrafish. The lateral line (LL), which is a fish specific superficial sensory organ, is an emerging organ model for studying complex cellular processes in the context of the whole living animal. Cell migration, mechanosensory cell development/differentiation and regeneration are some examples. This sensory system is made of superficial and sparse small sensory patches called neuromasts, with less than 50 cells in any given patch. The paucity of cells is a real problem in any effort to characterize those cells at the transcriptional level. We describe here a method which we applied to efficiently separate subpopulation of cells of the LL, using two distinct stable transgenic zebrafish lines, Tg(cldnb:gfp) and Tg(tnks1bp1:EGFP). In both cases, the GFP positive (GFP+) cells were separated from the remainder of the animal by using a Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). The transcripts of the GFP+ cells were subsequently analyzed on gene expression microarrays. The combination of FACS and microarrays is an efficient method to establish a transcriptional signature for discrete cell populations which would otherwise be masked in whole animal preparation. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Embryonic development requires a complex series of relative cellular movements and shape changes that are generally referred to as morphogenesis. Although some of the mechanisms underlying morphogenesis have been identified, the process is still poorly understood. Here, we address mechanisms of epithelial morphogenesis using the vertebrate lens as a model system. We show that the apical constriction of lens epithelial cells that accompanies invagination of the lens placode is dependent on Shroom3, a molecule previously associated with apical constriction during morphogenesis of the neural plate. We show that Shroom3 is required for the apical localization of F-actin and myosin II, both crucial components of the contractile complexes required for apical constriction, and for the apical localization of Vasp, a Mena family protein with F-actin anti-capping function that is also required for morphogenesis. Finally, we show that the expression of Shroom3 is dependent on the crucial lens-induction transcription factor Pax6. This provides a previously missing link between lens-induction pathways and the morphogenesis machinery and partly explains the absence of lens morphogenesis in Pax6-deficient mutants.},

abstract = {Hedgehog (Hh) is a paracrine signaling protein with major roles in development and disease. In vertebrates and invertebrates, Hh signal transduction is carried out almost entirely by evolutionarily conserved components, and in both, intercellular movement of Hh is mediated by cytonemes - specialized filopodia that serve as bridges that bring distant cells into contact. A significant difference is the role of the primary cilium, a slender, tubulin-based protuberance of many vertebrate cells. Although the primary cilium is essential for Hh signaling in cells that have one, most Drosophila cells lack a primary cilium. This perspective addresses the roles of primary cilia and cytonemes, and proposes that for Hh signaling, the role of primary cilia is to provide a specialized hydrophobic environment that hosts lipid-modified Hh and other components of Hh signal transduction after Hh has traveled from elsewhere in the cell. Implicit in this model is the idea that initial binding and uptake of Hh is independent of and segregated from the processes of signal transduction and activation.

Low photo-toxicity and high-speed multiview acquisition have made selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) a popular choice for studies of organ morphogenesis and function in zebrafish, Drosophila, and other model organisms. A multitude of different light sheet microscopes have emerged for the noninvasive imaging of specimens ranging from single molecules to cells, tissues, and entire embryos. In particular, developmental biology can benefit from the ability to watch developmental events occur in real time in an entire embryo, thereby advancing our understanding on how cells form tissues and organs. However, it presents a new challenge to our existing data and image processing tools. This review gives an overview of where we stand as light sheet microscopy branches out, explores new areas, and becomes more specialized.},

abstract = {Interneurons play pivotal roles in the modulation of cortical function; however, the mechanisms that control interneuron development remain unclear. This study aimed to explore a new role for Foxg1 in interneuron development. By crossing Foxg1(fl/fl) mice with a Dlx5/6-Cre line, we determined that conditional disruption of Foxg1 in the subpallium results in defects in interneuron development. In developing interneurons, the expression levels of several receptors, including roundabout-1, Eph receptor A4, and C-X-C motif receptor 4/7, were strongly downregulated, which led to migration defects after Foxg1 ablation. The transcription factors Dlx1/2 and Mash1, which have been reported to be involved in interneuron development, were significantly upregulated at the mRNA levels. Foxg1 mutant cells developed shorter neurites and fewer branches and displayed severe migration defects in vitro. Notably, Prox1, which is a transcription factor that functions as a key regulator in the development of excitatory neurons, was also dramatically upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that Prox1 is also important for interneuron development. Our work demonstrates that Foxg1 may act as a critical upstream regulator of Dlx1/2, Mash1, and Prox1 to control interneuron development. These findings will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of interneuron development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The preplacodal region (PPR) is a region of specialized ectoderm at the border of neural and nonneural ectoderm (NNE). Coordinated Bmp, Fgf, and Wnt signals are known to drive PPR development; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. RESULTS: We identified key components involved in PPR differentiation. The mesoderm/marginal Wnts at the early gastrula stage trigger differentiation by allowing the adjacent NNE border cells to start adopting caudal PPR fates; otherwise, the development of caudal PPR identity is hindered due to the persistent presence of gata3 mRNA. The caudal PPR fate dominates when foxi1 expression is enhanced at the late gastrula stage, and depleting Foxi1 after 6 hours postfertilization (hpf) reduces the otic-epibranchial placodal domain. When the Gata3 level is manipulated at the fertilized egg stage or near 6 hpf, the lens is always affected. In establishing PPR polarity, both Gata3 and Foxi1 inhibit Bmp signaling, whereas Foxi1 inhibits, but Gata3 enhances, Fgf sensitivity of the PPR cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that in zebrafish, (1) the PPR at the shield stage may enter a developmental state when the PPR cells preferentially adopt a particular placodal fate and (2) a network of genetically linked factors, including Wnt/beta-catenin, Fgfr, Bmp, Gata3, and Foxi1, direct the process of PPR differentiation.},

Intercellular cadherin-based adhesions adapt and respond to mechanical forces and cell density, while tight junctions flexibly control diffusion both within the plasma membrane and between adjacent cells. Epithelial integrity and homeostasis are of central importance to survival, and mechanisms have evolved to ensure these processes are maintained during growth and in response to damage. For instance, cell competition surveys the fitness of cells within epithelia and removes the less fit; extrusion or delamination can remove apoptotic or defective cells from the epithelial sheet and can restore homeostasis when an epithelial layer becomes too crowded; spindle orientation ensures two-dimensional growth in simple epithelia and controls stratification in complex epithelia; and transition to a mesenchymal phenotype enables active escape from an epithelial layer. This review will discuss these various mechanisms and consider how they are subverted in disease.},

abstract = {The posterior lateral line primordium (pLLp) migrates caudally, depositing neuromasts to establish the posterior lateral line system in zebrafish. A Wnt-dependent FGF signaling center at the leading end of the pLLp initiates the formation of `proneuromasts' by facilitating the reorganization of cells into epithelial rosettes and by initiating atoh1a expression. Expression of atoh1a gives proneuromast cells the potential to become sensory hair cells, and lateral inhibition mediated by Delta-Notch signaling restricts atoh1a expression to a central cell. We show that as atoh1a expression becomes established in the central cell, it drives expression of fgf10 and of the Notch ligand deltaD, while it inhibits expression of fgfr1. As a source of Fgf10, the central cell activates the FGF pathway in neighboring cells, ensuring that they form stable epithelial rosettes. At the same time, DeltaD activates Notch in neighboring cells, inhibiting atoh1a expression and ensuring that they are specified as supporting cells. When Notch signaling fails, unregulated atoh1a expression reduces Fgfr1 expression, eventually resulting in attenuated FGF signaling, which prevents effective maturation of epithelial rosettes in the pLLp. In addition, atoh1a inhibits e-cadherin expression, which is likely to reduce cohesion and contribute to fragmentation of the pLLp. Together, our observations reveal a genetic regulatory network that explains why atoh1a expression must be restricted by Notch signaling for effective morphogenesis of the pLLp.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Activation of the Drosophila receptor tyrosine kinase Torso (Tor) only at the termini of the embryo is achieved by the localized expression of the maternal gene Torso-like (Tsl). Tor has a second function in the prothoracic gland as the receptor for prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) that initiates metamorphosis. Consistent with the function of Tor in this tissue, Tsl also localizes to the prothoracic gland and influences developmental timing. Despite these commonalities, in our studies of Tsl we unexpectedly found that tsl and tor have opposing effects on body size; tsl null mutants are smaller than normal, rather than larger as would be expected if the PTTH/Tor pathway was disrupted. We further found that whereas both genes regulate developmental timing, tsl does so independently of tor. Although tsl null mutants exhibit a similar length delay in time to pupariation to tor mutants, in tsl:tor double mutants this delay is strikingly enhanced. Thus, loss of tsl is additive rather than epistatic to loss of tor. We also find that phenotypes generated by ectopic PTTH expression are independent of tsl. Finally, we show that a modified form of tsl that can rescue developmental timing cannot rescue terminal patterning, indicating that Tsl can function via distinct mechanisms in different contexts. We conclude that Tsl is not just a specialized cue for Torso signaling but also acts independently of PTTH/Tor in the control of body size and the timing of developmental progression. These data highlight surprisingly diverse developmental functions for this sole Drosophila member of the perforin-like superfamily.},

abstract = {Many animals and plants have symbiotic relationships with beneficial bacteria. Experimentally tractable models are necessary to understand the processes involved in the selective transmission of symbiotic bacteria. One such model is the transmission of the insect-pathogenic bacterial symbionts Photorhabdus spp. by Heterorhabditis bacteriophora infective juvenile (IJ)-stage nematodes. By observing egg-laying behavior and IJ development, it was determined that IJs develop exclusively via intrauterine hatching and matricide (i.e., endotokia matricida). By transiently exposing nematodes to fluorescently labeled symbionts, it was determined that symbionts infect the maternal intestine as a biofilm and then invade and breach the rectal gland epithelium, becoming available to the IJ offspring developing in the pseudocoelom. Cell- and stage-specific infection occurs again in the pre-IJ pharyngeal intestinal valve cells, which helps symbionts to persist as IJs develop and move to a new host. Synchronous with nematode development are changes in symbiont and host behavior (e.g., adherence versus invasion). Thus, Photorhabdus symbionts are maternally transmitted by an elaborate infectious process involving multiple selective steps in order to achieve symbiont-specific transmission.},

abstract = {The earliest known determinants of retinal nasotemporal identity are the transcriptional regulators Foxg1, which is expressed in the prospective nasal optic vesicle, and Foxd1, which is expressed in the prospective temporal optic vesicle. Previous work has shown that, in zebrafish, Fgf signals from the dorsal forebrain and olfactory primordia are required to specify nasal identity in the dorsal, prospective nasal, optic vesicle. Here, we show that Hh signalling from the ventral forebrain is required for specification of temporal identity in the ventral optic vesicle and is sufficient to induce temporal character when activated in the prospective nasal retina. Consequently, the evaginating optic vesicles become partitioned into prospective nasal and temporal domains by the opposing actions of Fgfs and Shh emanating from dorsal and ventral domains of the forebrain primordium. In absence of Fgf activity, foxd1 expression is established irrespective of levels of Hh signalling, indicating that the role of Shh in promoting foxd1 expression is only required in the presence of Fgf activity. Once the spatially complementary expression of foxd1 and foxg1 is established, the boundary between expression domains is maintained by mutual repression between Foxd1 and Foxg1.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Morphogens regulate tissue patterning through their distribution in concentration gradients. Emerging research establishes a role for specialized signalling filopodia, or cytonemes, in morphogen dispersion and signalling. Previously we demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen is transported via vesicles along cytonemes emanating from signal-producing cells to form a gradient in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Drosophila{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} epithelia. However, the mechanisms for signal reception and transfer are still undefined. Here, we demonstrate that cytonemes protruding from Hh-receiving cells contribute to Hh gradient formation. The canonical Hh receptor Patched is localized in these cellular protrusions and Hh reception takes place in membrane contact sites between Hh-sending and Hh-receiving cytonemes. These two sets of cytonemes have similar dynamics and both fall in two different dynamic behaviours. Furthermore, both the Hh co-receptor Interference hedgehog (Ihog) and the glypicans are critical for this cell-cell cytoneme mediated interaction. These findings suggest that the described contact sites might facilitate morphogen presentation and reception. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Stages are named, not numbered as in most other series, providing for flexibility and continued evolution of the staging series as we learn more about development in this species. The stages, and their names, are based on morphological features, generally readily identified by examination of the live embryo with the dissecting stereomicroscope. The descriptions also fully utilize the optical transparancy of the live embryo, which provides for visibility of even very deep structures when the embryo is examined with the compound microscope and Nomarski interference contrast illumination. Photomicrographs and composite camera lucida line drawings characterize the stages pictorially. Other figures chart the development of distinctive characters used as staging aid signposts.},

Through in situ hybridization, we report the temporal and spatial expression patterns of the four Shroom family members during early Xenopus development, from oocytes to tadpole stage embryos. Further, we show that Shroom1 and 2 mRNAs are maternally expressed, while Shroom3 and Shroom4 are zygotic transcripts. In addition, maternal Shroom1 and 2 mRNAs localize in the animal hemisphere of the Xenopus egg and early blastula. During later development, all four Shroom family proteins are broadly expressed in developing epithelial organs, and the epithelial cells that express Shrooms are elongated. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of Shroom2, like Shroom3, is able to increase cell height and that loss of Shroom2 function results in a failure of cell elongation in the neural epithelium. Together, these data suggest that Shroom family proteins play an important role in the morphogenesis of several different epithelial tissues during development.

abstract = {The vertebrate body plan features a consistent left-right (LR) asymmetry of internal organs. In several vertebrate embryos, motile cilia generate an asymmetric fluid flow that is necessary for normal LR development. However, the mechanisms involved in orienting LR asymmetric flow with previously established anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes remain poorly understood. In zebrafish, asymmetric flow is generated in Kupffer's vesicle (KV). The cellular architecture of KV is asymmetric along the AP axis, with more ciliated cells densely packed into the anterior region. Here, we identify a Rho kinase gene, rock2b, which is required for normal AP patterning of KV and subsequent LR development in the embryo. Antisense depletion of rock2b in the whole embryo or specifically in the KV cell lineage perturbed asymmetric gene expression in lateral plate mesoderm and disrupted organ LR asymmetries. Analyses of KV architecture demonstrated that rock2b knockdown altered the AP placement of ciliated cells without affecting cilia number or length. In control embryos, leftward flow across the anterior pole of KV was stronger than rightward flow at the posterior end, correlating with the normal AP asymmetric distribution of ciliated cells. By contrast, rock2b knockdown embryos with AP patterning defects in KV exhibited randomized flow direction and equal flow velocities in the anterior and posterior regions. Live imaging of Tg(dusp6:memGFP)(pt19) transgenic embryos that express GFP in KV cells revealed that rock2b regulates KV cell morphology. Our results suggest a link between AP patterning of the ciliated Kupffer's vesicle and LR patterning of the zebrafish embryo.},

abstract = {Cilia and flagella (interchangeable terms) are evolutionarily conserved organelles found on many different types of eukaryotic cells where they fulfill important functions in motility, sensory reception and signaling. The process of Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) is of central importance for both the assembly and maintenance of cilia, as it delivers building blocks from their site of synthesis in the cell body to the ciliary assembly site at the tip of the cilium. A key player in this process is the multi-subunit IFT-complex, which acts as an adapter between the motor proteins required for movement and the ciliary cargo proteins. Since the discovery of IFT more than 15 years ago, considerable effort has gone into the purification and characterization of the IFT complex proteins. Even though this has led to very interesting findings and has greatly improved our knowledge of the IFT process, we still know very little about the overall architecture of the IFT complex and the specific functions of the various subunits. In this review we will give an update on the knowledge of the structure and function of individual IFT proteins, and the way these proteins interact to form the complex that facilitates IFT. ?? 2011 International Society of Differentiation.},

abstract = {Optogenetics is an emerging and powerful technique that allows the control of protein activity with light. The possibility of inhibiting or stimulating protein activity with the spatial and temporal precision of a pulse of laser light is opening new frontiers for the investigation of developmental pathways and cell biological bases underlying organismal development. With this powerful technique in hand, it will be possible to address old and novel questions about how cells, tissues, and organisms form. In this review, we focus on the applications of existing optogenetic tools for addressing issues in animal morphogenesis. Interrogating Morphogenesis Morphogenesis, the shaping of living cells and tissues, is a formidably complex process that involves the concerted action of thousands of molecules at specific locations and at defined times. Across scales, from single-celled organisms to complex animals comprising tens of thousands of cells, the action of these molecules results in changes in cell behavior, which ultimately determine the function of the cell. For example, the unicellular yeast-like fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae can either form chains of elongated cells, or reproduce asexually by reorienting its actin cytoskeleton to form a polarized bud, depending on the availability of specific nutrients [1,2]. Similarly, in multicellular organisms, individual cells, such as neurons or intestinal epithelial cells, acquire different shapes that are adapted to perform a specific physiological function. On a larger scale, morphological remodeling is driven by changes in cell behavior in single cells or group of cells. For example, during embryonic development, tissue and organ growth are often initiated by localized changes in cell shape, motility, and proliferation rates. Therefore, understanding morphogenesis requires, on the one hand, an understanding of the way cells restructure their internal contents, and on the other, of how cells coordinate their behavior to build macroscopic structures. Bridging the subcellular and supracellular scales at the functional level requires tools that allow the control of protein activity and cell behavior with high spatiotemporal precision. Standard genetic approaches – knockdown, knockout, overexpression, and mutation – have broad effects on the organism and act on long timescales. Chemical approaches can rapidly switch on or off the function of specific proteins, but they do not allow spatial control. In the past years, laser dissection has become a popular tool to perturb single cells during morphogenesis [3–6]. This technique enables the severing of actomyosin filaments or microtubules with high intensity},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency, self-renewal and differentiation in embryonic cells and in stem cells. Therefore, control of gene expression at the level of transcription is crucial for embryonic development, as well as for organogenesis, functional adaptation, and regeneration in adult tissues and organs. In the past, most work has focused on how transcriptional regulation results from the complex interplay between chemical cues, adhesion signals, transcription factors and their co-regulators during development. However, chemical signaling alone is not sufficient to explain how three-dimensional (3D) tissues and organs are constructed and maintained through the spatiotemporal control of transcriptional activities. Accumulated evidence indicates that mechanical cues, which include physical forces (e.g. tension, compression or shear stress), alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics and changes in cell shape, are transmitted to the nucleus directly or indirectly to orchestrate transcriptional activities that are crucial for embryogenesis and organogenesis. In this Commentary, we review how the mechanical control of gene transcription contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency, determination of cell fate, pattern formation and organogenesis, as well as how it is involved in the control of cell and tissue function throughout embryogenesis and adult life. A deeper understanding of these mechanosensitive transcriptional control mechanisms should lead to new approaches to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {Background: The Drosophila neoplastic tumor suppressor Lethal (2) giant larvae (Lgl) controls apicobasal cell polarity and proliferation. We have previously shown that lgl
                        - clones in the developing eye exhibit ectopic proliferation and suppress apoptosis without affecting apicobasal cell polarity. Ectopic expression of the apical polarity regulators atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and Crumbs also leads to increased cell proliferation and/or survival. Here we investigate how these cell polarity regulators control proliferation and survival. Results: We report that depletion of lgl in eye epithelial tissue, where polarity is maintained, results in upregulation of targets of the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) tumor suppressor pathway. Consistent with this, the SWH pathway transcriptional coactivator Yorkie is hyperactivated in Lgl-deficient tissue and is rate limiting for lgl
                        - phenotypes. Overexpression of the apical polarity regulators Crumbs or aPKC also leads to ectopic expression of SWH pathway targets without affecting polarity. We show that Lgl depletion or aPKC overexpression results in comislocalization of Hippo and Ras-associated domain family protein (RASSF), consistent with RASSF's ability to block Hippo activation by Salvador. In contrast, Crumbs overexpression leads to mislocalization of Expanded away from the apical cortex, which is predicted to deregulate the pathway. Conclusions: Collectively, our data reveal that the cell polarity regulators Lgl, aPKC, and Crumbs regulate the SWH pathway by two distinct pathways: Lgl acts antagonistically to aPKC to regulate Hippo and RASSF localization, whereas Crumbs regulates Expanded localization. Thus, our study implicates Lgl, aPKC, and Crumbs as regulators of tissue growth via the SWH pathway. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During development, cells undergo dramatic changes in their morphology. By affecting contact geometry, these morphological changes could influence cellular communication. However, it has remained unclear whether and how signaling depends on contact geometry. This question is particularly relevant for Notch signaling, which coordinates neighboring cell fates through direct cell-cell signaling. Using micropatterning with a receptor trans-endocytosis assay, we show that signaling between pairs of cells correlates with their contact area. This relationship extends across contact diameters ranging from micrometers to tens of micrometers. Mathematical modeling predicts that dependence of signaling on contact area can bias cellular differentiation in Notch-mediated lateral inhibition processes, such that smaller cells are more likely to differentiate into signal-producing cells. Consistent with this prediction, analysis of developing chick inner ear revealed that ligand-producing hair cell precursors have smaller apical footprints than non-hair cells. Together, these results highlight the influence of cell morphology on fate determination processes.},

We nowreport that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in non- transformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phos- phorylation and increases its association with the p52 NF-$\kappa$B subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts p53's conforma- tion and transcriptional output toward a state resembling cancer-associated p53 mutants and endows p53 with the ability to promote cell migration. Notably, LATS1 and LATS2 are frequently down-regulated in breast cancer; we propose that such down-regulation might benefit can- cer by converting p53 from a tumor suppressor into a tu- mor facilitator.},

abstract = {The molecular and cellular mechanisms governing cell motility and directed migration in response to the chemokine SDF-1 are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that zebrafish primordial germ cells whose migration is guided by SDF-1 generate bleb-like protrusions that are powered by cytoplasmic flow. Protrusions are formed at sites of higher levels of free calcium where activation of myosin contraction occurs. Separation of the acto-myosin cortex from the plasma membrane at these sites is followed by a flow of cytoplasm into the forming bleb. We propose that polarized activation of the receptor CXCR4 leads to a rise in free calcium that in turn activates myosin contraction in the part of the cell responding to higher levels of the ligand SDF-1. The biased formation of new protrusions in a particular region of the cell in response to SDF-1 defines the leading edge and the direction of cell migration. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, genetics has proven to be a very powerful complementary approach to these embryological studies, as genetic screens for zebrafish mutants defective in somitogenesis have identified over 50 genes that are necessary for normal somite development. Zebrafish is thus an ideal system in which to analyze the role of specific gene prod- ucts in regulating the cell behaviors that under- lie somite development.

abstract = {Canonical Wnt signaling plays crucial roles during development and disease. How Wnt signaling is modulated in different in vivo contexts is currently not well understood. Here, we investigate the modulation of Wnt signaling in the posterior lateral line primordium (pLLP), a cohort of ∼100 cells that collectively migrate along the trunk of the zebrafish embryo. The pLLP comprises proliferative progenitor cells and organized epithelial cells that will form the mechanosensory organs of the posterior lateral line. Wnt signaling is active in the leading progenitor zone of the pLLP and restricted from the trailing zone through expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitors dkk1b and dkk2. We have identified a zebrafish strain, krm1 nl10 , which carries a mutation in the kremen1 gene, a non-obligate co-receptor for the Dkk family of proteins. Previous studies have shown that Kremen1 inhibits Wnt signaling by facilitating internalization of the Kremen1-Dkk-Lrp5/6 complex. Surprisingly, we found that disruption of Kremen1 in the pLLP exhibited molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with a decrease rather than overactivation of Wnt signaling. Transplantation of wild-type cells into the mutant primordia failed to rescue the krm1 nl10 phenotype, thus revealing that the effects of Kremen1 loss are non-cell-autonomous. Finally, ectopic expression of Dkk1b-mTangerine protein revealed larger spread of the fusion protein in the mutant primordia compared with the wild type. Based on our data, we propose a novel mechanism in which Kremen1 modulates Wnt activity by restricting the range of secreted Dkk proteins during collective cell migration in the pLLP.},

Unexpectedly, after decades as of obscurity it moved very fast into full limelight with the increasing evidence of it's central role in the many genetic variations leading to what is now known as ciliopathies (for overview see (31)). These studies implicated unique biological functions of the primary cilium, which now as then is not completely straightforward. In parallel and initially completely unrelated to the ciliopathies, the primary cilium was functionally characterized to make cells more susceptible to changes in fluid flow and thus, suggested to function as a flow-sensing device. This has been substantiated for many epithelial cell types over the years. Despite this, some of the central mechanism of the signal transduction has been left unanswered largely as a result of substantial technical challenges of working with this delicate organelle. The current review considers the resent advances that allow us to fill some of the holes in the model of signal transduction in the cilium-mediated flow response and to reach out for the physiological implications of this peculiar organelle.},

abstract = {Current fluorescent protein (FP) development strategies are focused on fine-tuning the photophysical properties of blue to yellow variants derived from the Aequorea victoria jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) and on the development of monomeric FPs from other organisms that emit in the yellow-orange to far-red regions of the visible light spectrum. Progress toward these goals has been substantial, and near-infrared emitting FPs may loom over the horizon. The latest efforts in jellyfish variants have resulted in new and improved monomeric BFP, CFP, GFP and YFP variants, and the relentless search for a bright, monomeric and fast-maturing red FP has yielded a host of excellent candidates, although none is yet optimal for all applications. Meanwhile, photoactivatable FPs are emerging as a powerful class of probes for intracellular dynamics and, unexpectedly, as useful tools for the development of superresolution microscopy applications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Notch-Delta signaling functions across a wide array of animal systems to break symmetry in a sheet of undifferentiated cells and generate cells with different fates, a process known as lateral inhibition. Unlike many other signaling systems, however, since both the ligand and receptor are transmembrane proteins, the activation of Notch by Delta depends strictly on cell-cell contact. Furthermore, the binding of the ligand to the receptor may not be sufficient to induce signaling, since recent work in cell culture suggests that ligand-induced Notch signaling also requires a mechanical pulling force. This tension exposes a cleavage site in Notch that, when cut, activates signaling. Although it is not known if mechanical tension contributes to signaling in vivo, others have suggested that this is how endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex contributes to the cleavage and activation of Notch. In a similar way, since Notch-mediated lateral inhibition at a distance in the dorsal thorax of the pupal fly is mediated via actin-rich protrusions, it is possible that cytoskeletal forces generated by networks of filamentous actin and non-muscle myosin during cycles of protrusion extension and retraction also contribute to Notch signaling. RESULTS To test this hypothesis, we carried out a detailed analysis of the role of myosin II-dependent tension in Notch signaling in the developing fly and in cell culture. Using dynamic fluorescence-based reporters of Notch, we found that myosin II is important for signaling in signal sending and receiving cells in both systems-as expected if myosin II-dependent tension across the Notch-Delta complex contributes to Notch activation. While myosin II was found to contribute most to signaling at a distance, it was also required for maximal signaling between adjacent cells that share lateral contacts and for signaling between cells in culture. CONCLUSIONS Together these results reveal a previously unappreciated role for non-muscle myosin II contractility in Notch signaling, providing further support for the idea that force contributes to the cleavage and activation of Notch in the context of ligand-dependent signaling, and a new paradigm for actomyosin-based mechanosensation.},

abstract = {Ciliopathies are a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of human developmental disorders whose root cause is the absence or dysfunction of primary cilia. Joubert syndrome is characterized by a distinctive hindbrain malformation variably associated with retinal dystrophy and cystic kidney disease. Mutations in CC2D2A are found in ∼10{\%} of patients with Joubert syndrome. Here we describe the retinal phenotype of cc2d2a mutant zebrafish consisting of disorganized rod and cone photoreceptor outer segments resulting in abnormal visual function as measured by electroretinogram. Our analysis reveals trafficking defects in mutant photoreceptors affecting transmembrane outer segment proteins (opsins) and striking accumulation of vesicles, suggesting a role for Cc2d2a in vesicle trafficking and fusion. This is further supported by mislocalization of Rab8, a key regulator of opsin carrier vesicle trafficking, in cc2d2a mutant photoreceptors and by enhancement of the cc2d2a retinal and kidney phenotypes with partial knockdown of rab8. We demonstrate that Cc2d2a localizes to the connecting cilium in photoreceptors and to the transition zone in other ciliated cell types and that cilia are present in these cells in cc2d2a mutants, arguing against a primary function for Cc2d2a in ciliogenesis. Our data support a model where Cc2d2a, localized at the photoreceptor connecting cilium/transition zone, facilitates protein transport through a role in Rab8-dependent vesicle trafficking and fusion.},

abstract = {Mesoderm formation is critical for the establishment of the animal body plan and in Drosophila requires the snail gene. This report concerns the cloning and expression pattern of the structurally similar gene snail1 from zebrafish. In situ hybridization shows that the quantity of snail1 RNA increases at the margin of the blastoderm in cells that involute during gastrulation. As gastrulation begins, snail1 RNA disappears from the dorsal axial mesoderm and becomes restricted to the paraxial mesoderm and the tail bud. snail1 RNA increases in cells that define the posterior border of each somite and then disappears when somitic cells differentiate. Later in development, expression appears in cephalic neural crest derivatives. Many snail1-expressing cells were missing from mutant spadetail embryos and the quantity of snail1 RNA was greatly reduced in mutant no tail embryos. The work presented here suggests that snail1 is involved in morphogenetic events during gastrulation, somitogenesis and development of the cephalic neural crest, and that no tail may act as a positive regulator of snail1.},

abstract = {Embryonic morphogenesis takes place via a series of dramatic collective cell movements. The mechanisms that coordinate these intricate structural transformations across an entire organism are not well understood. In this study, we used gentle mechanical deformation of developing zebrafish embryos to probe the role of physical forces in generating long-range intercellular coordination during epiboly, the process in which the blastoderm spreads over the yolk cell. Geometric distortion of the embryo resulted in nonuniform blastoderm migration and realignment of the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, as defined by the locations at which the head and tail form, toward the new long axis of the embryo and away from the initial animal-vegetal axis defined by the starting location of the blastoderm. We found that local alterations in the rate of blastoderm migration correlated with the local geometry of the embryo. Chemical disruption of the contractile ring of actin and myosin immediately vegetal to the blastoderm margin via Ca(2+) reduction or treatment with blebbistatin restored uniform migration and eliminated AP axis reorientation in mechanically deformed embryos; it also resulted in cellular disorganization at the blastoderm margin. Our results support a model in which tension generated by the contractile actomyosin ring coordinates epiboly on both the organismal and cellular scales. Our observations likewise suggest that the AP axis is distinct from the initial animal-vegetal axis in zebrafish.},

Although, the non-muscle myosin II holoenzyme (myosin) is a molecular motor that powers contraction of actin cytoskeleton networks, recent studies have questioned the importance of myosin motor activity cell and tissue shape changes. Here, combining the biochemical analysis of enzymatic and motile properties for purified myosin mutants with in vivo measurements of apical constriction for the same mutants, we show that in vivo constriction rate scales with myosin motor activity. We show that so-called phosphomimetic mutants of the Drosophila regulatory light chain (RLC) do not mimic the phosphorylated RLC state in vitro. The defect in the myosin motor activity in these mutants is evident in developing Drosophila embryos where tissue recoil following laser ablation is decreased compared to wild-type tissue. Overall, our data highlights that myosin activity is required for rapid cell contraction and tissue folding in developing Drosophila embryos.},

Despite recent reports linking Yki/YAP/TAZ activity to the actin cytoskeleton, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and/or controversial. Using Drosophila imaginal discs as an in vivo model, we show that Wts, but not Hpo, is genetically indispensable for cytoskeleton-mediated subcellular localization of Yki. Through a systematic screen, we identify the Ste-20 kinase Happyhour (Hppy) and its mammalian counterpart MAP4K1/2/3/5 as an alternative kinase that phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Wts/Lats in a similar manner as Hpo/Mst. Consistent with their redundant function as activating kinases of Wts/Lats, combined loss of Hpo/Mst and Hppy/MAP4K abolishes cytoskeleton-mediated regulation of Yki/YAP subcellular localization, as well as YAP cytoplasmic translocation induced by contact inhibition. These Hpo/Mst-like kinases provide an expanded view of the Hippo kinase cascade in development and physiology.},

Movement coordination between the YSL and blastoderm cells is dependent on contact between these tissues, and is probably required for the patterning and morphogenetic function of the YSL.

abstract = {An 80-kDa protein, prominently expressed in smooth muscle, was microsequenced and identified as LPP, the product of the lipoma-preferred partner gene (Petit MMR, Mols R, Schoenmakers EFPM, Mandahl N, and Van de Ven WJM. Genomics 36: 118-129, 1996). Using a specific anti-LPP antibody, we showed, in Western blots and with immunofluorescence microscopy, the selective expression of LPP in vascular and visceral smooth muscles (approximately 0.5-1 ng/microg total protein). In other mature (noncultured) tissues, including heart and skeletal muscle, the protein is present only in trace amounts and is closely correlated with the levels of the smooth muscle marker alpha-actin. In freshly isolated guinea pig bladder smooth muscle cells, immunofluorescence images showed LPP as linear arrays of punctate, longitudinally oriented staining superimposed with vinculin staining on the plasma membrane surface. A corresponding pattern of periodic labeling at the membrane in transverse sections of bladder smooth muscle suggested an association of LPP with peripheral dense bodies. In cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells, LPP colocalized with vinculin at focal adhesions but not with p120 catenin or alpha-actinin. Overexpression of the protein increased EGF-stimulated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in Transwell assays, suggesting the participation of LPP in cell motility. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 dissociated focal adhesions and LPP staining at the cell periphery and enhanced the nuclear accumulation of LPP induced by leptomycin B, indicating that LPP has a potential for relocating to the nucleus through a shuttling mechanism that is sensitive to inhibition of Rho-kinase.},

AJs comprise cadherin adhesion receptors and cytoplasmic proteins that associate with them, including catenins and actin filaments, and exhibit various forms, such as linear or punctate. Remodelling of AJs induces epithelial reshaping in various ways, including by planar-polarized apical constriction that is driven by the contraction of AJ-associated actomyosin and that occurs during neural plate bending and germband extension.

We look at examples to illustrate the importance of ground truth data design and use, including manual and automated methods. We then propose a method and corresponding ground truth dataset for measuring interest point detector response as compared to human visual system response and human expectations. Also included here are example applications of the general robustness criteria and the general vision taxonomy developed in Chapter 5 as applied to the preparation of hypothetical ground truth data. Lastly, we look at the current state of the art, its best practices, and a survey of available ground truth datasets. Key topics include: Creating and collecting ground truth data: manual vs. synthetic • methods Labeling and describing ground truth data: automated vs. human • annotated Selected ground truth datasets • Metrics paired with ground truth data • Over-fitting, under-fitting, and measuring quality • Publically available datasets • An example scenario that compares the human visual system to • machine vision detectors, using a synthetic ground truth dataset Ground truth data may not be a cutting-edge research area, however it is as important as the algorithms for machine vision. Let's explore some of the best-known methods and consider some open questions. In the context of computer vision, ground truth data includes a set of images, and a set of labels on the images, and defining a modelfor object recognition as discussed in Chapter 4, including the count, location, and relationships of key features. The labels are added either by a human or automatically by image analysis, depending on the complexity of the problem. The collection of labels, such as interest points, corners, feature descriptors, shapes, and histograms, form a model. A model may be trained using a variety of machine learning methods. At run-time, the detected features are fed into a classifier to measure the correspondence between detected features and modeled features. Modeling, classification, and training are statistical and machine learning problems , however, that are outside the scope of this book. Instead, we are concerned here with the content and design of the ground truth images. Creating a ground truth dataset, then, may include condieration of the following major tasks: • Model design. The model defines the composition of the objects—for example, the count, strength, and location relationship of a set of SIFT features. The model should be correctly fitted to the problem and image data so as to yield meaningful results.},

@article{Dupont2011a,
abstract = {Cells perceive their microenvironment not only through soluble signals but also through physical and mechanical cues, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness or confined adhesiveness. By mechanotransduction systems, cells translate these stimuli into biochemical signals controlling multiple aspects of cell behaviour, including growth, differentiation and cancer malignant progression, but how rigidity mechanosensing is ultimately linked to activity of nuclear transcription factors remains poorly understood. Here we report the identification of the Yorkie-homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1) as nuclear relays of mechanical signals exerted by ECM rigidity and cell shape. This regulation requires Rho GTPase activity and tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but is independent of the Hippo/LATS cascade. Crucially, YAP/TAZ are functionally required for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells induced by ECM stiffness and for survival of endothelial cells regulated by cell geometry; conversely, expression of activated YAP overrules physical constraints in dictating cell behaviour. These findings identify YAP/TAZ as sensors and mediators of mechanical cues instructed by the cellular microenvironment.},

@article{Valdivia2011a,
abstract = {During tissue morphogenesis and differentiation, cells must self-renew while contemporaneously generating daughters that contribute to the growing tissue. How tissues achieve this precise balance between proliferation and differentiation is, in most instances, poorly understood. This is in part due to the difficulties in dissociating the mechanisms that underlie tissue patterning from those that regulate proliferation. In the migrating posterior lateral line primordium (PLLP), proliferation is predominantly localised to the leading zone. As cells emerge from this zone, they periodically organise into rosettes that subsequently dissociate from the primordium and differentiate as neuromasts. Despite this reiterative loss of cells, the primordium maintains its size through regenerative cell proliferation until it reaches the tail. In this study, we identify a null mutation in the Wnt-pathway transcription factor Lef1 and show that its activity is required to maintain proliferation in the progenitor pool of cells that sustains the PLLP as it undergoes migration, morphogenesis and differentiation. In absence of Lef1, the leading zone becomes depleted of cells during its migration leading to the collapse of the primordium into a couple of terminal neuromasts. We show that this behaviour resembles the process by which the PLLP normally ends its migration, suggesting that suppression of Wnt signalling is required for termination of neuromast production in the tail. Our data support a model in which Lef1 sustains proliferation of leading zone progenitors, maintaining the primordium size and defining neuromast deposition rate.},

abstract = {The vast majority of mammalian DNA does not encode for proteins but instead is transcribed into noncoding (nc)RNAs having diverse regulatory functions. The poorly characterized subclass of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) can epigenetically regulate protein-coding genes by interacting locally in cis or distally in trans. A few reports have implicated specific lncRNAs in cardiac development or failure, but precise details of lncRNAs expressed in hearts and how their expression may be altered during embryonic heart development or by adult heart disease is unknown. Using comprehensive quantitative RNA sequencing data from mouse hearts, livers, and skin cells, we identified 321 lncRNAs present in the heart, 117 of which exhibit a cardiac-enriched pattern of expression. By comparing lncRNA profiles of normal embryonic (∼E14), normal adult, and hypertrophied adult hearts, we defined a distinct fetal lncRNA abundance signature that includes 157 lncRNAs differentially expressed compared with adults (fold-change ≥ 50{\%}, false discovery rate = 0.02) and that was only poorly recapitulated in hypertrophied hearts (17 differentially expressed lncRNAs; 13 of these observed in embryonic hearts). Analysis of protein-coding mRNAs from the same samples identified 22 concordantly and 11 reciprocally regulated mRNAs within 10 kb of dynamically expressed lncRNAs, and reciprocal relationships of lncRNA and mRNA levels were validated for the Mccc1 and Relb genes using in vitro lncRNA knockdown in C2C12 cells. Network analysis suggested a central role for lncRNAs in modulating NF$\kappa$B- and CREB1-regulated genes during embryonic heart growth and identified multiple mRNAs within these pathways that are also regulated, but independently of lncRNAs.},

@article{McGraw2011a,
abstract = {The zebrafish posterior lateral line (pLL) is a sensory system that comprises clusters of mechanosensory organs called neuromasts (NMs) that are stereotypically positioned along the surface of the trunk. The NMs are deposited by a migrating pLL primordium, which is organized into polarized rosettes (proto-NMs). During migration, mature proto-NMs are deposited from the trailing part of the primordium, while progenitor cells in the leading part give rise to new proto-NMs. Wnt signaling is active in the leading zone of the primordium and global Wnt inactivation leads to dramatic disorganization of the primordium and a loss of proto-NM formation. However, the exact cellular events that are regulated by the Wnt pathway are not known. We identified a mutant strain, lef1(nl2), that contains a lesion in the Wnt effector gene lef1. lef1(nl2) mutants lack posterior NMs and live imaging reveals that rosette renewal fails during later stages of migration. Surprisingly, the overall primordium patterning, as assayed by the expression of various markers, appears unaltered in lef1(nl2) mutants. Lineage tracing and mosaic analyses revealed that the leading cells (presumptive progenitors) move out of the primordium and are incorporated into NMs; this results in a decrease in the number of proliferating progenitor cells and eventual primordium disorganization. We concluded that Lef1 function is not required for initial primordium organization or migration, but is necessary for proto-NM renewal during later stages of pLL formation. These findings revealed a novel role for the Wnt signaling pathway during mechanosensory organ formation in zebrafish.},

However, the limited availability of protocols for smFISH in embryos and the lack of efficient image analysis pipelines have hampered quantification at the (sub)cellular level in complex samples like tissues and embryos. Here, we present a protocol for smFISH on zebrafish embryo sections in combination with an image analysis pipeline for automated transcript detection and cell segmentation. We use this strategy to quantify gene expression differences between different cell types and identify differences in subcellular transcript localization between genes. The combination of our smFISH protocol and custom-made, freely available, analysis pipeline will enable researchers to fully exploit the benefits of quantitative transcript analysis at cellular and subcellular resolution in tissues and embryos.},

When a protein is tagged by fusion to a fluorescent protein, interactions between fluorescent proteins can undesirably disturb targeting or function. Unfortunately, all wild-type yellow-to-red fluorescent proteins reported so far are obligately tetrameric and often toxic or disruptive. The first true monomer was mRFP1, derived from the Discosoma sp. fluorescent protein "DsRed" by directed evolution first to increase the speed of maturation, then to break each subunit interface while restoring fluorescence, which cumulatively required 33 substitutions. Although mRFP1 has already proven widely useful, several properties could bear improvement and more colors would be welcome. We report the next generation of monomers. The latest red version matures more completely, is more tolerant of N-terminal fusions and is over tenfold more photostable than mRFP1. Three monomers with distinguishable hues from yellow-orange to red-orange have higher quantum efficiencies.},

abstract = {Hair is a primary characteristic of mammals, and exerts a wide range of functions including thermoregulation, physical protection, sensory activity, and social interactions. The hair shaft consists of terminally differentiated keratinocytes that are produced by the hair follicle. Hair follicle development takes place during fetal skin development and relies on tightly regulated ectodermal-mesodermal interactions. After birth, mature and actively growing hair follicles eventually become anchored in the subcutis, and periodically regenerate by spontaneously undergoing repetitive cycles of growth (anagen), apoptosis-driven regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen). Our molecular understanding of hair follicle biology relies heavily on mouse mutants with abnormalities in hair structure, growth, and/or pigmentation. These mice have allowed novel insights into important general molecular and cellular processes beyond skin and hair biology, ranging from organ induction, morphogenesis and regeneration, to pigment and stem cell biology, cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. In this review, we present basic concepts of hair follicle biology and summarize important recent advances in the field. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The emergence of left-right (L-R) asymmetry during embryogenesis is a classic problem in developmental biology. It is only since the 1990s, however, that substantial insight into this problem has been achieved by molecular and genetic approaches. Various genes required for L-R asymmetric morphogenesis in vertebrates have now been identified, and many of these genes are required for the formation and motility of cilia. Breaking of L-R symmetry in the mouse embryo occurs in the ventral node, where two types of cilia are present. Whereas centrally located motile cilia generate a leftward fluid flow, peripherally located immotile cilia sense a flow-dependent signal, which is either chemical or mechanical in nature. Although Ca2+ signaling is implicated in flow sensing, the precise mechanism remains unknown. Here we summarize current knowledge of L-R symmetry breaking in vertebrates (focusing on the mouse), with a special emphasis on the roles of cilia, fluid flow, and Ca2+ signaling. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

These developments are based on the application of small molecule inducers of gene expression, antisense- or RNA interference-mediated gene silencing, and the photochemical control of proteins regulating gene function. The majority of the examples employ a classical 'caging technology', through the chemical installation of a light-removable protecting group on the biological molecule (small molecule, oligonucleotide, or protein) of interest and rendering it inactive. UV light irradiation then removes the caging group and activates the molecule, enabling control over gene activity with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

abstract = {The Hippo signaling pathway inhibits cell growth and regulates organ size through a kinase cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the growth-promoting transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Yorkie. It mediates contact inhibition of cell growth downstream of cadherin adhesion molecules and other cell surface proteins. Contact inhibition is often antagonized by mitogenic growth factor signaling. We report an important mechanism for this antagonism, inhibition of Hippo pathway signaling by mitogenic growth factors. EGF treatment of immortalized mammary cells triggers the rapid translocation of YAP into the nucleus along with YAP dephosphorylation, both of which depend on Lats, the terminal kinase in the Hippo pathway. A small-molecule inhibitor screen of downstream effector pathways shows that EGF receptor inhibits the Hippo pathway through activation of PI3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1), but independent of AKT activity. The PI3K-PDK1 pathway also mediates YAP nuclear translocation downstream of lysophosphatidic acid and serum as a result of constitutive oncogenic activation of PI3K. PDK1 associates with the core Hippo pathway-kinase complex through the scaffold protein Salvador. The entire Hippo core complex dissociates in response to EGF signaling in a PI3K-PDK1-dependent manner, leading to inactivation of Lats, dephosphorylation of YAP, and YAP nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation of its target gene, CTGF. These findings show that an important activity of mitogenic signaling pathways is to inactivate the growth-inhibitory Hippo pathway and provide a mechanism for antagonism between contact inhibition and growth factor action.},

abstract = {Summary Nephronophthisis (NPHP), Joubert (JBTS), and Meckel-Gruber (MKS) syndromes are autosomal-recessive ciliopathies presenting with cystic kidneys, retinal degeneration, and cerebellar/neural tube malformation. Whether defects in kidney, retinal, or neural disease primarily involve ciliary, Hedgehog, or cell polarity pathways remains unclear. Using high-confidence proteomics, we identified 850 interactors copurifying with nine NPHP/JBTS/MKS proteins and discovered three connected modules: “NPHP1-4-8” functioning at the apical surface, “NPHP5-6” at centrosomes, and “MKS” linked to Hedgehog signaling. Assays for ciliogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis in 3D renal cultures link renal cystic disease to apical organization defects, whereas ciliary and Hedgehog pathway defects lead to retinal or neural deficits. Using 38 interactors as candidates, linkage and sequencing analysis of 250 patients identified ATXN10 and TCTN2 as new NPHP-JBTS genes, and our Tctn2 mouse knockout shows neural tube and Hedgehog signaling defects. Our study further illustrates the power of linking proteomic networks and human genetics to uncover critical disease pathways.},

abstract = {We cloned and mapped two novel zebrafish genes, cxcr4a and cxcr4b, which are closely related to mammalian CXCR4. Expression analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization demonstrated that these two genes are expressed in most cell lineages known to express Cxcr4 in mammals. These genes are co-expressed in lateral mesoderm and posterior midbrain. The transcripts of cxcr4a were detected in interneurons and endoderm, whereas cxcr4b was specifically expressed in sensory neurons, motoneurons and cerebellum. In the lateral mesoderm, cxcr4b transcripts appeared earlier than those of cxcr4a. Thus, the function of mammalian CXCR4 could be split between the two zebrafish genes. These genes probably derived from the genome duplication event, which occurred during the evolution of teleosts. Similar pairs of Cxcr4 may exist in other species, where genome duplication has occurred. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wilkinson2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The centrosome is the cell's microtubule organising centre, an organelle with important roles in cell division, migration and polarity. However, cells can divide and flies can, for a large part of development, develop without them. Many centrosome proteins have been identified but the roles of most are still poorly understood. The centrioles of the centrosome are similar to the basal bodies of cilia, hair-like extensions of many cells that have important roles in cell signalling and development. In a number of human diseases, such Bardet-Biedl syndrome, centrosome/cilium proteins are mutated, leading to polycystic kidney disease, situs inversus, and neurological problems, amongst other symptoms.

RESULTS: We describe zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos depleted for two uncharacterised, centrosome proteins, Cep70 and Cep131. The phenotype of these embryos resembles that of zebrafish mutants for intraflagellar transport proteins (IFTs), with kidney and ear development affected and left-right asymmetry randomised. These organs and processes are those affected in Bardet-Biedl syndrome and other similar diseases. Like these diseases, the root cause of the phenotype lies, in fact, in dysfunctional cilia, which are shortened but not eliminated in several tissues in the morphants. Centrosomes and basal bodies, on the other hand, are present. Both Cep70 and Cep131 possess a putative HDAC (histone deacetylase) interacting domain. However, we could not detect in yeast two-hybrid assays any interaction with the deacetylase that controls cilium length, HDAC6, or any of the IFTs that we tested.

CONCLUSION: Cep70 and Cep131 contribute to ciliogenesis in many tissues in the zebrafish embryo: cilia are made in cep70 and cep131 morphant zebrafish embryos but are shortened. We propose that the role of these centrosomal/basal body proteins is in making the cilium and that they are involved in determination of the length of the axoneme.},

abstract = {Vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signals involved in development and some forms of cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma, are transduced by the primary cilium, a microtubular projection found on many cells. A critical step in vertebrate Hh signal transduction is the regulated movement of Smoothened (Smo), a seven-transmembrane protein, to the primary cilium. To identify small molecules that interfere with either the ciliary localization of Smo or ciliogenesis, we undertook a high-throughput, microscopy-based screen for compounds that alter the ciliary localization of YFP-tagged Smo. This screen identified 10 compounds that inhibit Hh pathway activity. Nine of these Smo antagonists (SA1-9) bind Smo, and one (SA10) does not. We also identified two compounds that inhibit ciliary biogenesis, which block microtubule polymerization or alter centrosome composition. Differential labeling of cell surface and intracellular Smo pools indicates that SA1-7 and 10 specifically inhibit trafficking of intracellular Smo to cilia. In contrast, SA8 and 9 recruit endogenous Smo to the cilium in some cell types. Despite these different mechanisms of action, all of the SAs inhibit activation of the Hh pathway by an oncogenic form of Smo, and abrogate the proliferation of basal cell carcinoma-like cancer cells. The SA compounds may provide alternative means of inhibiting pathogenic Hh signaling, and our study reveals that different pools of Smo move into cilia through distinct mechanisms.},

In this study, we isolated and characterized Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus spp. from across Thailand together with their associated nematode symbionts, and characterized their phylogenetic diversity. EPNs were isolated from soil samples using a Galleria-baiting technique. Bacteria from EPNs were cultured and genotyped based on recA sequence. The nematodes were identified based on sequences of 28S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer regions. A total of 795 soil samples were collected from 159 sites in 13 provinces across Thailand. A total of 126 EPNs isolated from samples taken from 10 provinces were positive for Xenorhabdus (n = 69) or Photorhabdus spp. (n = 57). Phylogenetic analysis separated the 69 Xenorhabdus isolates into 4 groups. Groups 1, 2 and 3 consisting of 52, 13 and 1 isolates related to X. stockiae, and group 4 consisting of 3 isolates related to X. miraniensis. The EPN host for isolates related to X. stockiae was S. websteri, and for X. miraniensis was S. khoisanae. The Photorhabdus species were identified as P. luminescens (n = 56) and P. asymbiotica (n = 1). Phylogenenic analysis divided P. luminescens into five groups. Groups 1 and 2 consisted of 45 and 8 isolates defined as subspecies hainanensis and akhurstii, respectively. One isolate was related to hainanensis and akhurstii, two isolates were related to laumondii, and one isolate was the pathogenic species P. asymbiotica subsp. australis. H. indica was the major EPN host for Photorhabdus. This study reveals the genetic diversity of Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus spp. and describes new associations between EPNs and their bacterial symbionts in Thailand.},

This mutation is designated shroom (shrm) because the neural folds “mushroom” outward and do not converge at the dorsal midline. shrm encodes a PDZ domain protein that is involved at several levels in regulating aspects of cytoarchitecture. First, endogenous Shrm localizes to adherens junctions and the cytoskeleton. Second, ectopically expressed Shrm alters the subcellular distribution of F-actin. Third, Shrm directly binds F-actin. Finally, cytoskeletal polarity within the neuroepithelium is perturbed in mutant embryos. In concert, these observations suggest that Shrm is a critical determinant of the cellular architecture required for proper neurulation.},

abstract = {The lateral line system of fish and amphibians detects water flow with receptors on the surface of the body. Although differences in the shape of these receptors, called neuromasts, are known to influence their mechanics, it is unclear how neuromast morphology affects the sensitivity of the lateral line system. We examined the functional consequences of morphological variation by measuring the dimensions of superficial neuromasts in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio) and mathematically modeling their mechanics. These measurements used a novel morphometric technique that recorded landmarks in three dimensions at a microscopic scale. The mathematical model predicted mechanical sensitivity as the ratio of neuromast deflection to flow velocity for a range of stimulus frequencies. These predictions suggest that variation in morphology within this species generates a greater than 30-fold range in the amplitude of sensitivity and more than a 200-fold range of variation in cut-off frequency. Most of this variation was generated by differences in neuromast height that do not correlate with body position. Our results suggest that natural variation in cupular height within a species is capable of generating large differences in their mechanical filtering and dynamic range.},

abstract = {Modern applications in the life sciences are frequently based on in vivo imaging of biological specimens, a domain for which light microscopy approaches are typically best suited. Often, quantitative information must be obtained from large multicellular organisms on the cellular or even subcellular level and with a good temporal resolution. However, this usually requires a combination of conflicting features: high imaging speed, low photobleaching, and low phototoxicity in the specimen, good three-dimensional (3D) resolution, an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, and multiple-view imaging capability. The latter feature refers to the capability of recording a specimen along multiple directions, which is crucial for the imaging of large specimens with strong light-scattering or light-absorbing tissue properties. An imaging technique that fulfills these requirements is essential for many key applications: For example, studying fast cellular processes over long periods of time, imaging entire embryos throughout development, or reconstructing the formation of morphological defects in mutants. Here, we discuss digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy (DSLM) as a novel tool for quantitative in vivo imaging in the post-genomic era and show how this emerging technique relates to the currently most widely applied 3D microscopy techniques in biology: confocal fluorescence microscopy and two-photon microscopy.},

abstract = {To learn more about cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), we have isolated fibroblasts from different stages of breast cancer progression and analysed their function and gene expression. These analyses reveal that activation of the YAP transcription factor is a signature feature of CAFs. YAP function is required for CAFs to promote matrix stiffening, cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis. Remodelling of the ECM and promotion of cancer cell invasion requires the actomyosin cytoskeleton. YAP regulates the expression of several cytoskeletal regulators, including ANLN and DIAPH3, and controls the protein levels of MYL9 (also known as MLC2). Matrix stiffening further enhances YAP activation, thus establishing a feed-forward self-reinforcing loop that helps to maintain the CAF phenotype. Actomyosin contractility and Src function are required for YAP activation by stiff matrices. Further, transient ROCK inhibition is able to disrupt the feed-forward loop, leading to a long-lasting reversion of the CAF phenotype.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in microscopy and genetic labeling strategies have created new opportunities for time-lapse imaging of embryonic development. However, methods for immobilizing embryos for long periods while maintaining normal development have changed little. In zebrafish, current immobilization techniques rely on the anesthetic tricaine. Unfortunately, prolonged tricaine treatment at concentrations high enough to immobilize the embryo produces undesirable side effects on development. We evaluate three alternative immobilization strategies: combinatorial soaking in tricaine and isoeugenol, injection of $\alpha$-bungarotoxin protein, and injection of $\alpha$-bungarotoxin mRNA. We find evidence for co-operation between tricaine and isoeugenol to give immobility with improved health. However, even in combination these anesthetics negatively affect long-term development. $\alpha$-bungarotoxin is a small protein from snake venom that irreversibly binds and inactivates acetylcholine receptors. We find that $\alpha$-bungarotoxin either as purified protein from snakes or endogenously expressed in zebrafish from a codon-optimized synthetic gene can immobilize embryos for extended periods of time with few health effects or developmental delays. Using $\alpha$-bungarotoxin mRNA injection we obtain complete movies of zebrafish embryogenesis from the 1-cell stage to 3 days post fertilization, with normal health and no twitching. These results demonstrate that endogenously expressed $\alpha$-bungarotoxin provides unprecedented immobility and health for time-lapse microscopy.},

abstract = {Two theories address the origin of repeating patterns, such as hair follicles, limb digits, and intestinal villi, during development. The Turing reaction-diffusion system posits that interacting diffusible signals produced by static cells first define a prepattern that then induces cell rearrangements to produce an anatomical structure. The second theory, that of mesenchymal self-organisation, proposes that mobile cells can form periodic patterns of cell aggregates directly, without reference to any prepattern. Early hair follicle development is characterised by the rapid appearance of periodic arrangements of altered gene expression in the epidermis and prominent clustering of the adjacent dermal mesenchymal cells. We assess the contributions and interplay between reaction-diffusion and mesenchymal self-organisation processes in hair follicle patterning, identifying a network of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), wingless-related integration site (WNT), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling interactions capable of spontaneously producing a periodic pattern. Using time-lapse imaging, we find that mesenchymal cell condensation at hair follicles is locally directed by an epidermal prepattern. However, imposing this prepattern's condition of high FGF and low BMP activity across the entire skin reveals a latent dermal capacity to undergo spatially patterned self-organisation in the absence of epithelial direction. This mesenchymal self-organisation relies on restricted transforming growth factor (TGF) $\beta$ signalling, which serves to drive chemotactic mesenchymal patterning when reaction-diffusion patterning is suppressed, but, in normal conditions, facilitates cell movement to locally prepatterned sources of FGF. This work illustrates a hierarchy of periodic patterning modes operating in organogenesis.},

abstract = {Focal malformations of cortical development (FMCDs) account for the majority of drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy. Postzygotic somatic mutations activating the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway are found in a wide range of brain diseases, including FMCDs. It remains unclear how a mutation in a small fraction of cells disrupts the architecture of the entire hemisphere. Within human FMCD-affected brain, we found that cells showing activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were enriched for the AKT3(E17K) mutation. Introducing the FMCD-causing mutation into mouse brain resulted in electrographic seizures and impaired hemispheric architecture. Mutation-expressing neural progenitors showed misexpression of reelin, which led to a non-cell autonomous migration defect in neighboring cells, due at least in part to derepression of reelin transcription in a manner dependent on the forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor FOXG1. Treatments aimed at either blocking downstream AKT signaling or inactivating reelin restored migration. These findings suggest a central AKT-FOXG1-reelin signaling pathway in FMCD and support pathway inhibitors as potential treatments or therapies for some forms of focal epilepsy.},

abstract = {Primordial germ cell (PGC) migration in zebrafish is directed by the chemokine SDF-1a that activates its receptor CXCR4b. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the distribution of this chemoattractant in vivo. We demonstrate that the activity of a second SDF-1/CXCL12 receptor, CXCR7, is crucial for proper migration of PGCs toward their targets. We show that CXCR7 functions primarily in the somatic environment rather than within the migrating cells. In CXCR7 knocked-down embryos, the PGCs exhibit a phenotype that signifies defects in SDF-1a gradient formation as the cells fail to polarize effectively and to migrate toward their targets. Indeed, somatic cells expressing CXCR7 show enhanced internalization of the chemokine suggesting that CXCR7 acts as a sink for SDF-1a, thus allowing the dynamic changes in the transcription of sdf-1a to be mirrored by similar dynamics at the protein level. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Specialized sensory organs in the vertebrate head originate from thickenings in the embryonic ectoderm called cranial sensory placodes. These placodes, as well as the neural crest, arise from a zone of ectoderm that borders the neural plate. This zone separates into a precursor field for the neural crest that lies adjacent to the neural plate, and a precursor field for the placodes, called the pre-placodal region (PPR), that lies lateral to the neural crest. The neural crest domain and the PPR are established in response to signaling events mediated by BMPs, FGFs and Wnts, which differentially activate transcription factors in these territories. In the PPR, members of the Six and Eya families, act in part to repress neural crest specific transcription factors, thus solidifying a placode developmental program. Subsequently, in response to environmental cues the PPR is further subdivided into placodal territories with distinct characteristics, each expressing a specific repertoire of transcription factors that provide the necessary information for their progression to mature sensory organs. In this review we summarize recent advances in the characterization of the signaling molecules and transcriptional effectors that regulate PPR specification and its subdivision into placodal domains with distinct identities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The posterior lateral line in zebrafish develops from a migrating primordium that deposits clusters of cells that differentiate into neuromasts at regular intervals along the trunk. The deposition of these neuromasts is known to be coordinated by Wnt and FGF signals that control the proliferation, migration, and organization of the primordium. However, little is known about the control of proliferation in the neuromasts following their deposition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show that pharmacological activation of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway with 1-azakenpaullone upregulates proliferation in neuromasts post-deposition. This results in increased size of the neuromasts and overproduction of sensory hair cells. We also show that activation of Wnt signaling returns already quiescent supporting cells to a proliferative state in mature neuromasts. Additionally, activation of Wnt signaling increases the number of supporting cells that return to the cell cycle in response to hair cell damage and the number of regenerated hair cells. Finally, we show that inhibition of Wnt signaling by overexpression of dkk1b suppresses proliferation during both differentiation and regeneration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling is both necessary and sufficient for the control of proliferation of lateral line progenitors during development, ongoing growth of the neuromasts, and hair cell regeneration.},

abstract = {Members of the Hedgehog (Hh) family of intercellular signaling molecules play crucial roles in animal development. Aberrant regulation of Hh signaling in humans causes developmental defects, and leads to various genetic disorders and cancers. We have characterized a novel regulator of Hh signaling through the analysis of the zebrafish midline mutant iguana (igu). Mutations in igu lead to reduced expression of Hh target genes in the ventral neural tube, similar to the phenotype seen in zebrafish mutants known to affect Hh signaling. Contradictory at first sight, igu mutations lead to expanded Hh target gene expression in somites. Genetic and pharmacological analyses revealed that the expression of Hh target genes in igu mutants requires Gli activator function but does not depend on Smoothened function. Our results show that the ability of Gli proteins to activate Hh target gene expression in response to Hh signals is generally reduced in igu mutants both in the neural tube and in somites. Although this reduced Hh signaling activity leads to a loss of Hh target gene expression in the neural tube, the same low levels of Hh signaling appear to be sufficient to activate Hh target genes throughout somites because of different threshold responses to Hh signals. We also show that Hh target gene expression in igu mutants is resistant to increased protein kinase A activity that normally represses Hh signaling. Together, our data indicate that igu mutations impair both the full activation of Gli proteins in response to Hh signals, and the negative regulation of Hh signaling in tissues more distant from the source of Hh. Positional cloning revealed that the igu locus encodes Dzip1, a novel intracellular protein that contains a single zinc-finger protein-protein interaction domain. Overexpression of Igu/Dzip1 proteins suggested that Igu/Dzip1 functions in a permissive way in the Hh signaling pathway. Taken together, our studies show that Igu/Dzip1 functions as a permissive factor that is required for the proper regulation of Hh target genes in response to Hh signals.},

abstract = {All animal embryos pass through a stage during which developmental control is handed from maternally provided gene products to those synthesized from the zygotic genome. This maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) has been extensively studied in model organisms, including echinoderms, nematodes, insects, fish, amphibians and mammals. In all cases, the MZT can be subdivided into two interrelated processes: first, a subset of maternal mRNAs and proteins is eliminated; second, zygotic transcription is initiated. The timing and scale of these two events differ across species, as do the cellular and morphogenetic processes that sculpt their embryos. In this article, we discuss conserved and distinct features within the two component processes of the MZT.},

abstract = {In situ analysis of biomarkers is highly desirable in molecular pathology because it allows the examination of biomarker status within the histopathological context of clinical specimens. Immunohistochemistry and DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) are widely used in clinical settings to assess protein and DNA biomarkers, respectively, but clinical use of in situ RNA analysis is rare. This disparity is especially notable when considering the abundance of RNA biomarkers discovered through whole-genome expression profiling. This is largely due to the high degree of technical complexity and insufficient sensitivity and specificity of current RNA ISH techniques. Here, we describe RNAscope, a novel RNA ISH technology with a unique probe design strategy that allows simultaneous signal amplification and background suppression to achieve single-molecule visualization while preserving tissue morphology. RNAscope is compatible with routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and can use either conventional chromogenic dyes for bright-field microscopy or fluorescent dyes for multiplex analysis. Unlike grind-and-bind RNA analysis methods such as real-time RT-PCR, RNAscope brings the benefits of in situ analysis to RNA biomarkers and may enable rapid development of RNA ISH-based molecular diagnostic assays. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

abstract = {Dysfunction of renal primary cilia leads to polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We previously showed that the exocyst, a protein trafficking complex, is essential for ciliogenesis, and is regulated by multiple Rho and Rab family GTPases, such as Cdc42. Cdc42 deficiency resulted in a disruption of renal ciliogenesis and a PKD phenotype in zebrafish and mice. Here we investigate the role of Tuba, a Cdc42-specific GEF, in ciliogenesis and nephrogenesis using Tuba knockdown MDCK cells, and tuba knockdown in zebrafish. Tuba depletion resulted in an absence of cilia, with impaired apical polarization and inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced tubulogenesis in Tuba knockdown MDCK cell cysts cultured in a collagen gel. In zebrafish, tuba was expressed in multiple ciliated organs, and, accordingly, tuba morphants showed various ciliary mutant phenotypes in these organs. Co-injection of tuba and cdc42 morpholinos at low doses, which alone had no effect, resulted in genetic synergy, and led to abnormal kidney development with highly disorganized pronephric duct cilia. Given the molecular nature of Cdc42 and Tuba, our data strongly suggest that tuba and cdc42 act in the same ciliogenesis pathway. Our study demonstrates that Tuba deficiency causes an abnormal renal ciliary and morphogenetic phenotype. Tuba most likely plays a critical role in ciliogenesis and nephrogenesis by regulating Cdc42 activity.},

abstract = {YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) are major downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway that influences tissue homeostasis, organ size, and cancer development. Aberrant hyperactivation of YAP/TAZ causes tissue overgrowth and tumorigenesis, whereas their inactivation impairs tissue development and regeneration. Dynamic and precise control of YAP/TAZ activity is thus important to ensure proper physiological regulation and homeostasis of the cells. Here, we show that YAP/TAZ activation results in activation of their negative regulators, LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2) kinases, to constitute a negative feedback loop of the Hippo pathway in both cultured cells and mouse tissues. YAP/TAZ in complex with the transcription factor TEAD (TEA domain family member) directly induce LATS2 expression. Furthermore, YAP/TAZ also stimulate the kinase activity of LATS1/2 through inducing NF2 (neurofibromin 2). This feedback regulation is responsible for the transient activation of YAP upon lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulation and the inhibition of YAP-induced cell migration. Thus, this LATS-mediated feedback loop provides an efficient mechanism to establish the robustness and homeostasis of YAP/TAZ regulation.},

abstract = {Images in fluorescence microscopy are inherently blurred due to the limit of diffraction of light. The purpose of deconvolution microscopy is to compensate numerically for this degradation. Deconvolution is widely used to restore fine details of 3D biological samples. Unfortunately, dealing with deconvolution tools is not straightforward. Among others, end users have to select the appropriate algorithm, calibration and parametrization, while potentially facing demanding computational tasks. To make deconvolution more accessible, we have developed a practical platform for deconvolution microscopy called DeconvolutionLab. Freely distributed, DeconvolutionLab hosts standard algorithms for 3D microscopy deconvolution and drives them through a user-oriented interface. In this paper, we take advantage of the release of DeconvolutionLab2 to provide a complete description of the software package and its built-in deconvolution algorithms. We examine several standard algorithms used in deconvolution microscopy, notably: Regularized inverse filter, Tikhonov regularization, Landweber, Tikhonov–Miller, Richardson–Lucy, and fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding. We evaluate these methods over large 3D microscopy images using simulated datasets and real experimental images. We distinguish the algorithms in terms of image quality, performance, usability and computational requirements. Our presentation is completed with a discussion of recent trends in deconvolution, inspired by the results of the Grand Challenge on deconvolution microscopy that was recently organized.},

However, the function of these proteins during embryonic development is not understood, and information on their expression during the earliest stages of development is limited. We have recently demonstrated constitutive and stress inducible expression of a homologue of human Hsp27 in adult zebrafish, an important experimental model of vertebrate developmental processes. Here, we assessed the temporospatial dynamics of zebrafish Hsp27 (hsp27) and alpha-B crystallin (cryab) gene expression using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and hsp27 expression by in situ hybridization. Our results reveal that initial upregulation of hsp27 expression occurs during early gastrulation. Expression of hsp27 is detected transiently in developing myotomes, lens and brain, and more persistently in developing heart. The constitutive expression level of hsp27 in embryos at some stages of development is considerably greater than that observed in unstressed adult tissues. Expression of hsp27 was also observed in all tissues examined in embryos recovering from heat stress. The pattern of expression observed for hsp27 overlaps partially, but not completely, with that reported for other heat shock proteins.},

abstract = {The collective migration of cells in the form of cohesive tissues is a hallmark of both morphogenesis and repair. The extrinsic cues that direct these complex migrations usually act by regulating the dynamics of a specific subset of cells, those at the leading edge. Given that normally the function of tissue migration is to lay down multicellular structures, such as branched epithelial networks or sensory organs, it is surprising how little is known about the mechanisms that organize cells behind the leading edge. Cells of the zebrafish lateral line primordium switch from mesenchyme-like leader cells to epithelial rosettes that develop into mechanosensory organs. Here, we show that this transition is regulated by an Fgf signaling circuit that is active within the migrating primordium. Point sources of Fgf ligand drive surrounding cells towards a ;non-leader' fate by increasing their epithelial character, a prerequisite for rosette formation. We demonstrate that the dynamic expression of Fgf ligands determines the spatiotemporal pattern of epithelialization underlying sensory organ formation in the lateral line. Furthermore, this work uncovers a surprising link between internal tissue organization and collective migration.},

Sensory neurites accompany this primordium during its migration and are thereby guided to their prospective target organs. We show that the inactivation of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signaling leads to defects of innervation and that these defects are due to the inability of sensory axons to track the migrating primordium. GDNF signaling is also used as a guidance cue during axonal regeneration following nerve cut. We conclude that GDNF is a major determinant of directed neuritic growth and of target finding in this system, and we propose that GDNF acts by promoting local neurite outgrowth.},

abstract = {Cilia are microtubule-based structures that project into the extracellular space. Ciliary defects are associated with several human diseases, including polycystic kidney disease, primary ciliary dyskinesia, left-right axis patterning, hydrocephalus and retinal degeneration. However, the genetic and cellular biological control of ciliogenesis remains poorly understood. The IFT46 is one of the highly conserved intraflagellar transport complex B proteins. In zebrafish, ift46 is expressed in various ciliated tissues such as Kupffer׳s vesicle, pronephric ducts, ears and spinal cord. We show that ift46 is localized to the basal body. Knockdown of ift46 gene results in multiple phenotypes associated with various ciliopathies including kidney cysts, pericardial edema and ventral axis curvature. In ift46 morphants, cilia in kidney and spinal canal are shortened and abnormal. Similar ciliary defects are observed in otic vesicles, lateral line hair cells, olfactory pits, but not in Kupffer׳s vesicle. To explore the functions of Ift46 during mouse development, we have generated Ift46 knock-out mice. The Ift46 mutants have developmental defects in brain, neural tube and heart. In particular Ift46(-/-) homozygotes displays randomization of the embryo heart looping, which is a hallmark of defective left-right (L/R) axis patterning. Taken together, our results demonstrated that IFT46 has an essential role in vertebrate ciliary development.},

abstract = {arl13b was initially cloned as the novel cystic kidney gene scorpion (sco) in zebrafish and was shown to be required for cilia formation in the kidney duct. In mouse, a null mutant of Arl13b shows abnormal ultrastructure of the cilium and defective sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Importantly, a recent study linked mutations in ARL13B to a classical form of Joubert syndrome (JS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a distinctive cerebellar malformation. In this study, we analyzed the zebrafish arl13b (sco) mutant and gene products in detail. We first demonstrate that Arl13b is a protein that is highly enriched in the cilium and is required for cilia formation in multiple organs in zebrafish, and that knockdown of arl13b leads to multiple cilia-associated phenotypes. We additionally show that multiple regions of Arl13b are required for its localization to the cilium. By means of rescuing experiments with a series of deletion and point mutants, we further demonstrate that the ciliary localization is crucial for the in vivo function of Arl13b. Together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that JS-related disease (JSRD) is a ciliopathy, or a disease caused by ciliary defects, and that Arl13b functions mainly through the cilium.},

A comprehensive collection of reverse genetics tools has been developed for studying gene function in this useful organism. Morpholino is the most widely used reagent to knock down target gene expression post-transcriptionally. For a long time, targeted genome modification has been heavily relied on large-scale traditional forward genetic screens, such as ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) mutagenesis derived TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) strategy and pseudo-typed retrovirus mediated insertional mutagenesis. Recently, engineered endonucleases, including ZFNs (zinc finger nucleases) and TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases), provide new and efficient strategies to directly generate site-specific indel mutations by inducing double strand breaks in target genes. Here we summarize the major reverse genetic approaches for loss-of-function studies used and emerging in zebrafish, including strategies based on genome-wide mutagenesis and methods for site-specific gene targeting. Future directions and expectations will also be discussed.},

abstract = {Pharmacological manipulations in the Drosophila embryo have been hindered by the impermeability of the eggshell. The ultimate barrier to delivery of small molecule solutes to the embryo is the waxy layer that lies beneath the external chorion layers and encases the underlying vitelline membrane of the eggshell. Conventional protocols call for heptane or octane to permeablize the dechorionated eggshell however, these solvents are toxic and can result in low viability. Furthermore, heptane and octane require transition of the embryo between aqueous and organic phase solvents making it challenging to avoid desiccation. Here we describe an embryo permeabilization solvent (EPS) composed of d-limonene and plant-derived surfactants that is water miscible and highly effective in rendering the dechorionated eggshell permeable. EPS permeabilization enables embryo uptake of several different dyes of various molecular mass up to 995Da. We find that the embryo undergoes an age-dependent decrease in the ability to be permeabilized in the first six to eight hours after egg laying. This apparent developmental change in the vitelline membrane contributes to the heterogeneity in permeabilization seen even among closely staged embryos. However, using fluorescent properties of Rhodamine B dye and various conditions of EPS treatment we demonstrate the ability to obtain optimally permeabilized viable embryos. We also demonstrate the ability to assess teratogenic activity of several compounds applied to embryos in vitro, using both early and late developmental endpoints. Application of the method to transgenic strains carrying GFP-reporter genes results in a robust readout of pharmacological alteration of embryogenesis. The straightforward and rapid nature of the manipulations needed to prepare batches of permeabilized embryos has the potential of establishing the Drosophila embryo as an alternative model in toxicology and for small molecule screening in a high-throughput format.},

abstract = {Notch signaling is ubiquitously used to coordinate differentiation between adjacent cells across metazoans. Whereas Notch pathway components have been studied extensively, the effect of membrane distribution and dynamics of Notch receptors and ligands remains poorly understood. It is also unclear how cellular morphology affects these distributions and, ultimately, the signaling between cells. Here, we combine live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling to address these questions. We use a FRAP-TIRF assay to measure the diffusion and endocytosis rates of Delta-like 1 (Dll1) in mammalian cells. We find large cell-to-cell variability in the diffusion coefficients of Dll1 measured in single cells within the same population. Using a simple reaction-diffusion model, we show how membrane dynamics and cell morphology affect cell-cell signaling. We find that differences in the diffusion coefficients, as observed experimentally, can dramatically affect signaling between cells. Together, these results elucidate how membrane dynamics and cellular geometry can affect cell-cell signaling. Khait et al. show large cell-to-cell variability in the diffusion coefficients of the Notch ligand Delta-like 1. A combination of quantitative FRAP-TIRF imaging and mathematical modeling is used to examine the implications of this result on Notch signaling and its dependence on cell-cell contact geometry.},

abstract = {Animals have evolved two general strategies to counter injury and maintain physiological function. The most prevalent is protection by isolating vital organs into body cavities. However, protection is not optimal for sensory systems because their external components need to be exposed to the environment to fulfill their receptive function. Thus, a common strategy to maintain sensory abilities against persistent environmental insult involves repair and regeneration. However, whether age or frequent injuries affect the regenerative capacity of sensory organs remains unknown. We have found that neuromasts of the zebrafish lateral line regenerate mechanosensory hair cells after recurrent severe injuries and in adulthood. Moreover, neuromasts can reverse transient imbalances of Notch signaling that result in defective organ proportions during repair. Our results reveal inextinguishable hair-cell regeneration in the lateral line, and suggest that the neuromast epithelium is formed by plastic territories that are maintained by continuous intercellular communication.},

Spindle orientation is therefore important for a wide range of developmental processes, ranging from germline stem cell division to epithelial tissue homeostasis and regeneration. In multiple cell types in multiple animals, spindle orientation is controlled by a conserved biological machine that mediates a pulling force on astral microtubules. Restricting the localization of this machine to only specific regions of the cortex can thus determine how the mitotic spindle is oriented. As we review here, recent findings based on studies in tunicate, worm, fly and vertebrate cells have revealed that the mechanisms for mediating this restriction are surprisingly diverse.},

abstract = {Lateral line neuromasts of the bullseye Parapriacanthus ransonetti and the cardinal fish Apogon cyanosoma were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Neuromasts showed large numbers of degenerating hair cells and immature hair cells, suggesting a high degree of hair cell turnover. New hair cells were mainly produced in pairs (fewer than 5{\%} appear singly), the two cells of a pair having opposite but parallel orientations of their mechanosensitive axes. It is suggested that each pair results, directly or indirectly, from a single mitosis. The results further suggest that the axis of mitosis is one of the factors which determine the direction of the hair cell axis of mechanosensitivity.},

abstract = {Nucleic acid-induced gene silencing, such as RNA interference (RNAi), induces a multitude of responses in addition to the knockdown of a gene. This is best understood in the context of the antiviral immune response, from which the processes of RNAi are thought to be derived. Viral challenge of a vertebrate host leads to an intricate series of responses that orchestrate antiviral immunity. The success of this multifaceted system in overcoming viral encounters hinges on complex pathogen-host interactions. One aspect of these interactions, the nucleic acid-based immune response, is key to the successful resolution of a viral challenge. In particular, dsRNA, a nucleic acid associated with viral replication, is involved in numerous interactions contributing to induction, activation and regulation of antiviral mechanisms. Specifically, dsRNA is responsible for stimulating important protective responses, such as the activation of dicer-related antiviral pathways, induction of type 1 IFN, and stimulation of dsRNA-activated protein kinase and oligoadenylate synthetase. Furthermore, the modulation and shaping of this overall immune response is facilitated through nucleic acid interactions with pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptor 3. These diverse dsRNA-induced antiviral responses have implications for biotechnologies that use dsRNA to harness one arm of the host antiviral machinery for silencing a specific target gene. The interlinked nature of these response elements means that it may be difficult to completely isolate one element from the other arms of the antiviral response program of an organism. Thus, it is beneficial to understand all aspects of the immune response to dsRNA in order to manipulate these systems and minimize unwanted non-specific effects.},

abstract = {The Hippo pathway restricts the activity of transcriptional co-activators TAZ and YAP by phosphorylating them for cytoplasmic sequestration or degradation. In this report, we describe an independent mechanism for the cell to restrict the activity of TAZ and YAP through interaction with angiomotin (Amot) and angiomotin-like 1 (AmotL1). Amot and AmotL1 were robustly co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged TAZ, and their interaction is dependent on the WW domain of TAZ and the PPXY motif in the N terminus of Amot. Amot and AmotL1 also interact with YAP via the first WW domain of YAP. Overexpression of Amot and AmotL1 caused cytoplasmic retention of TAZ and suppressed its transcriptional outcome such as the expression of CTGF and Cyr61. Hippo refractory TAZ mutant (S89A) is also negatively regulated by Amot and AmotL1. HEK293 cells express the highest level of Amot and AmotL1 among nine cell lines examined, and silencing the expression of endogenous Amot increased the expression of CTGF and Cyr61 either at basal levels or upon overexpression of exogenous S89A. These results reveal a novel mechanism to restrict the activity of TAZ and YAP through physical interaction with Amot and AmotL1.},

abstract = {The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly being used to study basic vertebrate biology and human disease with a rich array of in vivo genetic and molecular tools. However, the inability to readily modify the genome in a targeted fashion has been a bottleneck in the field. Here we show that improvements in artificial transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provide a powerful new approach for targeted zebrafish genome editing and functional genomic applications. Using the GoldyTALEN modified scaffold and zebrafish delivery system, we show that this enhanced TALEN toolkit has a high efficiency in inducing locus-specific DNA breaks in somatic and germline tissues. At some loci, this efficacy approaches 100{\%}, including biallelic conversion in somatic tissues that mimics phenotypes seen using morpholino-based targeted gene knockdowns. With this updated TALEN system, we successfully used single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides to precisely modify sequences at predefined locations in the zebrafish genome through homology-directed repair, including the introduction of a custom-designed EcoRV site and a modified loxP (mloxP) sequence into somatic tissue in vivo. We further show successful germline transmission of both EcoRV and mloxP engineered chromosomes. This combined approach offers the potential to model genetic variation as well as to generate targeted conditional alleles.},

abstract = {Homozygous loss of the warts (wts) gene of Drosophila, caused by mitotic recombination in somatic cells, leads to the formation of cell clones that are fragmented, rounded, and greatly overgrown compared with normal controls. Therefore, the gene is required for the control of the amount and direction of cell proliferation as well as for normal morphogenesis. The absence of wts function also results in apical hypertrophy of imaginal disc epithelial cells. Secretion of cuticle over and between the domed apical surfaces of these cells leads to a honeycomb-like structure and gives the superficial wart-like phenotype of mitotic clones on the adult. One wts allele allows survival of homozygotes to the late larval stage, and these larvae show extensive imaginal disc overgrowth. Because of the excess growth and abnormalities of differentiation that follow homozygous loss, we consider wts to be a tumor suppressor gene. The wts gene is defined by the breakpoints of overlapping deficiencies in the right telomeric region of chromosome 3, region 100A, and by lethal P-element insertions and excisions. It encodes a protein kinase that is most similar to human myotonic dystrophy kinase, the Neurospora cot-1 protein kinase, two cell-cycle regulated kinases of yeast, and several putative kinases from plants. These proteins define a new subfamily of protein kinases that are closely related to but distinct from the cyclic AMP-dependent kinases. Although myotonic dystrophy is defined by a neuromuscular disorder, it is sometimes associated with multiple pilomatrixomas, which are otherwise rare epithelial tumors, and with other tumors including neurofibromas and parathyroid adenomas. Our results raise the possibility that homozygous loss of the myotonic dystrophy kinase may contribute to the development of these tumors.},

Placode progenitors are initially spread and intermixed within a continuous embryonic territory surrounding the anterior neural plate, the so-called pan-placodal region, which progressively breaks into distinct and compact placodal structures. The mechanisms driving the formation of these discrete placodes from the initial scattered distribution of their progenitors are poorly understood, and the implication of cell fate changes, local sorting out or massive cell movements is still a matter of debate. Here, we discuss different models that could account for placode assembly and review recent studies unraveling novel cellular and molecular aspects of this key event in the construction of the vertebrate head.},

By conducting a genome-scale cDNA overexpression screen, we have identified the Rho GAP family member Arhgap36 as a positive regulator of the Hh pathway in vitro and in vivo. Arhgap36 acts in a Smoothened (Smo)-independent manner to inhibit Gli repressor formation and to promote the activation of full-length Gli proteins. Arhgap36 concurrently induces the accumulation of Gli proteins in the primary cilium, and its ability to induce Gli-dependent transcription requires kinesin family member 3a and intraflagellar transport protein 88, proteins that are essential for ciliogenesis. Arhgap36 also functionally and biochemically interacts with Suppressor of Fused. Transcriptional profiling further reveals that Arhgap36 is overexpressed in murine medulloblastomas that acquire resistance to chemical Smo inhibitors and that ARHGAP36 isoforms capable of Gli activation are up-regulated in a subset of human medulloblastomas. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of Gli transcription factor activation and implicate ARHGAP36 dysregulation in the onset and/or progression of GLI-dependent cancers.},

abstract = {The transcription factor Six1 and its cofactor Eya1 are important regulators of neurogenesis in cranial placodes, activating genes promoting both a progenitor state, such as hes8, and neuronal differentiation, such as neurog1. Here, we use gain and loss of function studies in Xenopus laevis to elucidate how these genes function during placodal neurogenesis. We first establish that hes8 is activated by Notch signaling and represses neurog1 and neuronal differentiation, indicating that it mediates lateral inhibition. Using hes8 knockdown we demonstrate that hes8 is essential for limiting neuronal differentiation during normal placode development. We next show that Six1 and Eya1 cell autonomously activate both hes8 and neurog1 in a dose-dependent fashion, with increasing upregulation at higher doses, while neuronal differentiation is increasingly repressed. However, high doses of Six1 and Eya1 upregulate neurog1 only transiently, whereas low doses of Six1 and Eya1 ultimately promote both neurog1 expression and neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that Six1 and Eya1 can activate hes8 and arrest neuronal differentiation even when Notch signaling is blocked. Our findings indicate that Six1 and Eya1 can both promote and arrest neuronal differentiation by activating the Notch pathway genes neurog1 and hes8, respectively, revealing a novel mechanism of Six1/Eya1 action during placodal neurogenesis.},

The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that approximately 70{\%} of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.},

abstract = {The differentiation of cilia is mediated by kinesin-driven transport. As the function of kinesins in vertebrate ciliogenesis is poorly characterized, we decided to determine the role of kinesin-2 family motors--heterotrimeric kinesin-II and the homodimeric Kif17 kinesin--in zebrafish cilia. We report that kif17 is largely dispensable for ciliogenesis; kif17 homozygous mutant animals are viable and display subtle morphological defects of olfactory cilia only. In contrast to that, the kif3b gene, encoding a heterotrimeric kinesin subunit, is necessary for cilia differentiation in most tissues, although exceptions exist, and include photoreceptors and a subset of hair cells. Cilia of these cell types persist even in kif3b/kif17 double mutants. Although we have not observed a functional redundancy of kif3b and kif17, kif17 is able to substitute for kif3b in some cilia. In contrast to kif3b/kif17 double mutants, simultaneous interference with kif3b and kif3c leads to the complete loss of photoreceptor and hair cell cilia, revealing redundancy of function. This is in agreement with the idea that Kif3b and Kif3c motor subunits form complexes with Kif3a, but not with each other. Interestingly, kif3b mutant photoreceptor cilia differentiate with a delay, suggesting that kif3c, although redundant with kif3b at later stages of differentiation, is not active early in photoreceptor ciliogenesis. Consistent with that, the overexpression of kif3c in kif3b mutants rescues early photoreceptor cilia defects. These data reveal unexpected diversity of functional relationships between vertebrate ciliary kinesins, and show that the repertoire of kinesin motors changes in some cilia during their differentiation.},

abstract = {One of the most significant problems facing developmental biologists who do not work on an organism with well-developed genetics - and even for some who do - is how to inhibit the action of a gene of interest during development so as to learn about its normal biological function. A widely adopted approach is to use antisense technologies, and especially morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. In this article, we review the use of such reagents and present examples of how they have provided insights into developmental mechanisms. We also discuss how the use of morpholinos can lead to misleading results, including off-target effects, and we suggest controls that will allow researchers to interpret morpholino experiments correctly.},

abstract = {Developmental biology requires rapid embryo injections and screening. We applied new affordable high-resolution 3D-printing to create five easily modifiable stamp-mold tools that greatly increase injection and screening speed, while simultaneously reducing the harmful aspects of these processes. We designed two stamps that use different approaches to improve the injection efficiency for two different types of embryo, first for embryos from the snail Crepidula fornicata, and second, for those from the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. Both drastically improved injection speeds and embryo survival rates, even in novice hands. The other three tools were designed for rapid side-by-side organism orientating and comparison. The first screening tool allows for optimal imaging in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, while the second and third facilitate rapid high-throughput screening of Xenopus tropicalis tadpoles and Danio rerio juveniles, respectively. These designs can act as templates for many injection or screening applications.},

The stability of the synthetic fluorophores makes them attractive choices for long-term imaging and allows, unlike most of the autofluorescent proteins, the use of acid fixatives such as trichloroacetic acid. Furthermore, the use of O(6) -benzylguanine derivatives bearing caged fluorescein allows cell lineage tracing through photo-deprotection of the fluorophore and its detection either through fluorescence microscopy or through immunohistochemistry after fixation using anti-fluorescein antibodies.},

abstract = {Back to TopAbstract Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), nephronophthisis (NPHP), and related ciliopathies present with overlapping phenotypes and display considerable allelism between at least twelve different genes of largely unexplained function. We demonstrate that the conserved C. elegans B9 domain (MKS-1, MKSR-1, and MKSR-2), MKS-3/TMEM67, MKS-5/RPGRIP1L, MKS-6/CC2D2A, NPHP-1, and NPHP-4 proteins exhibit essential, collective functions at the transition zone (TZ), an underappreciated region at the base of all cilia characterized by Y-shaped assemblages that link axoneme microtubules to surrounding membrane. These TZ proteins functionally interact as members of two distinct modules, which together contribute to an early ciliogenic event. Specifically, MKS/MKSR/NPHP proteins establish basal body/TZ membrane attachments before or coinciding with intraflagellar transport–dependent axoneme extension and subsequently restrict accumulation of nonciliary components within the ciliary compartment. Together, our findings uncover a unified role for eight TZ-localized proteins in basal body anchoring and establishing a ciliary gate during ciliogenesis, and suggest that disrupting ciliary gate function contributes to phenotypic features of the MKS/NPHP disease spectrum.},

In mouse, Atoh1 is necessary for hair cell differentiation, but its role in specifying the equivalence group (proneural function) has been questioned and little is known about its upstream activators. We have addressed these issues in zebrafish. Two zebrafish homologs, atoh1a and atoh1b, are together necessary for hair cell development. These genes crossregulate each other but are differentially required during distinct developmental periods, first in the preotic placode and later in the otic vesicle. Interactions with the Notch pathway confirm that atoh1 genes have early proneural function. Fgf3 and Fgf8 are upstream activators of atoh1 genes during both phases, and foxi1, pax8 and dlx genes regulate atoh1b in the preplacode. A model is presented in which zebrafish atoh1 genes operate in a complex network leading to hair cell development.},

abstract = {Tubulin post-translational modifications generate microtubule heterogeneity and modulate microtubule function, and are catalyzed by tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) proteins. Using antibodies specific to monoglycylated, polyglycylated, and glutamylated tubulin in whole mount immunostaining of zebrafish embryos, we observed distinct, tissue-specific patterns of tubulin modifications. Tubulin modification patterns in cilia correlated with the expression of ttll3 and ttll6 in ciliated cells. Expression screening of all zebrafish tubulin tyrosine ligase-like genes revealed additional tissue-specific expression of ttll1 in brain neurons, ttll4 in muscle, and ttll7 in otic placodes. Knockdown of ttll3 eliminated cilia tubulin glycylation but had surprisingly mild effects on cilia structure and motility. Similarly, knockdown of ttll6 strongly reduced cilia tubulin glutamylation but only partially affected cilia structure and motility. Combined loss of function of ttll3 and ttll6 caused near complete loss of cilia motility and induced a variety of axonemal ultrastructural defects similar to defects previously observed in zebrafish fleer mutants, which were shown to lack tubulin glutamylation. Consistently, we find that fleer mutants also lack tubulin glycylation. These results indicate that tubulin glycylation and glutamylation have overlapping functions in maintaining cilia structure and motility and that the fleer/dyf-1 TPR protein is required for both types of tubulin post-translational modification.},

After unsupervised training, the learned trace represents a canonical, high resolution fusion of all the replicates. As well, an alignment in time and scale of each observation to this trace can be found by inference in the model.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bilateral symmetry during vertebrate development is broken at the left-right organizer (LRO) by ciliary motility and the resultant directional flow of extracellular fluid. However, how ciliary motility is perceived and transduced into asymmetrical intracellular signaling at the LRO remains controversial. Previous work has indicated that sensory cilia and polycystin-2 (Pkd2), a cation channel, are required for sensing ciliary motility, yet their function and the molecular mechanism linking both to left-right signaling cascades are unknown.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we report novel intraciliary calcium oscillations (ICOs) at the LRO that connect ciliary sensation of ciliary motility to downstream left-right signaling. Utilizing cilia-targeted genetically encoded calcium indicators in live zebrafish embryos, we show that ICOs depend on Pkd2 and are left-biased at the LRO in response to ciliary motility. Asymmetric ICOs occur with onset of LRO ciliary motility, thus representing the earliest known LR asymmetric molecular signal. Suppression of ICOs using a cilia-targeted calcium sink reveals that they are essential for LR development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that intraciliary calcium initiates LR development and identify cilia as a functional ion signaling compartment connecting ciliary motility and flow to molecular LR signaling.},

abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge.

abstract = {Epithelial cells undergo dynamic polarity changes as organs pattern, but the relationship between epithelial polarity and cell fate is poorly understood. Using the developing lung as a model, we found that distinct alterations in apical-basal polarity dictate airway epithelial differentiation. We demon- strate that Crb3, a Crumbs isoform that determines epithelial apical domain identity, is required for airway differentiation by controlling the localization of the transcriptional regulator Yap. We show that Crb3 promotes the interaction between Yap and the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 at apical cell junctions to induce Yap phosphorylation and cyto- plasmic retention, which drive cell differentiation. Loss of Crb3 in developing mouse airways or iso- lated adult airway progenitors results in unrestricted nuclear Yap activity and consequent cell differentia- tion defects. Our findings demonstrate that polarity- dependent cues control airway cell differentiation, offering important molecular insights into organ patterning.},

abstract = {During development, organ primordia reorganize to form repeated functional units. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), mechanosensory organs called neuromasts are deposited at regular intervals by the migrating posterior lateral line (pLL) primordium. The pLL primordium is organized into polarized rosettes representing proto-neuromasts, each with a central atoh1a-positive focus of mechanosensory precursors. We show that rosettes form cyclically from a progenitor pool at the leading zone of the primordium as neuromasts are deposited from the trailing region. fgf3/10 signals localized to the leading zone are required for rosette formation, atoh1a expression, and primordium migration. We propose that the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) source controls primordium organization, which, in turn, regulates the periodicity of neuromast deposition. This previously unrecognized mechanism may be applicable to understanding segmentation and morphogenesis in other organ systems.},

abstract = {Since the discovery that numerous proteins involved in mammalian disease localize to the basal bodies and cilia, these organelles have emerged from relative obscurity to the center of intense research efforts in an expanding number of disease- and developmental-related fields. Our understanding of the association between cilia and human disease has benefited substantially from the use of lower organisms such as Chlamydomonas and Caenorhabditis elegans and the availability of murine models and cell culture. These research endeavors led to the discovery that loss of normal ciliary function in mammals is responsible for cystic and noncystic pathology in the kidney, liver, brain, and pancreas, as well as severe developmental patterning abnormalities. In addition, the localization of proteins involved in rare human disorders such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome has suggested that cilia-related dysfunction may play a role in modern human epidemics such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Although we have made great advances in demonstrating the importance of cilia over the past decade, the physiological role that this organelle plays in most tissues remains elusive. Research focused on addressing this issue will be of critical importance for a further understanding of how ciliary dysfunction can lead to such severe disease and developmental pathologies.},

abstract = {Targeted genome editing using engineered nucleases has rapidly gone from being a niche technology to a mainstream method used by many biological researchers. This widespread adoption has been largely fueled by the emergence of the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology, an important new approach for generating RNA-guided nucleases, such as Cas9, with customizable specificities. Genome editing mediated by these nucleases has been used to rapidly, easily and efficiently modify endogenous genes in a wide variety of biomedically important cell types and in organisms that have traditionally been challenging to manipulate genetically. Furthermore, a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed to recruit heterologous domains that can regulate endogenous gene expression or label specific genomic loci in living cells. Although the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 systems remain to be fully defined, the power of these systems to perform targeted, highly efficient alterations of genome sequence and gene expression will undoubtedly transform biological research and spur the development of novel molecular therapeutics for human disease.},

However, several studies under physiological conditions demonstrate that microglial function is indispensable also in the healthy brain. Indeed, microglia implement key functions already during development, such as the clearance of the huge amount of neurons that are produced in large excess in the embryo and later die of apoptosis. Beside these classical functions, however, novel roles are emerging that strikingly link microglia with higher order brain functions and show that these cells can ultimately influence behaviour. Therefore a detailed understanding of microglia under physiological conditions may open unprecedented perspectives in the prevention and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases.},

abstract = {Expressing a gene in cells in which it is not normally active is a powerful way of determining its function. The GAL4 system allows the selective expression of any cloned gene in a wide variety of cell- and tissue-specific patterns in Drosophila. A promoter (or enhancer) directs expression of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 in a particular pattern, and GAL4 in turn directs transcription of the GAL4-responsive (UAS) target gene in an identical pattern. The system's key feature is that the GAL4 gene and UAS-target gene are initially separated into two distinct transgenic lines. In the GAL4 line, the activator protein is present, but has no target gene to activate. In the UAS-target gene line, the target gene is silent because the activator is absent. It is only when the GAL4 line is crossed to the UAS-target gene line that the target gene is turned on in the progeny. In this article we describe, in detail, how to generate and characterize GAL4 lines and how to prepare UAS-target gene lines. Vector maps are provided for pGaTB, P[GawB], and pP[UAST]. In addition, we consider the range of UAS-reporters currently available and review several new modifications of the GAL4 system.},

abstract = {Primary cilia are ubiquitous, microtubule-based organelles that play diverse roles in sensory transduction in many eukaryotic cells. They interrogate the cellular environment through chemosensing, osmosensing, and mechanosensing using receptors and ion channels in the ciliary membrane. Little is known about the mechanical and structural properties of the cilium and how these properties contribute to ciliary perception. We probed the mechanical responses of primary cilia from kidney epithelial cells [Madin-Darby canine kidney-II (MDCK-II)], which sense fluid flow in renal ducts. We found that, on manipulation with an optical trap, cilia deflect by bending along their length and pivoting around an effective hinge located below the basal body. The calculated bending rigidity indicates weak microtubule doublet coupling. Primary cilia of MDCK cells lack interdoublet dynein motors. Nevertheless, we found that the organelles display active motility. 3D tracking showed correlated fluctuations of the cilium and basal body. These angular movements seemed random but were dependent on ATP and cytoplasmic myosin-II in the cell cortex. We conclude that force generation by the actin cytoskeleton surrounding the basal body results in active ciliary movement. We speculate that actin-driven ciliary movement might tune and calibrate ciliary sensory functions.},

A genetic dissection of this problem is afforded by the migrating lateral line primordium of the zebrafish. We report that interactions between Wnt/??-catenin and Fgf signaling maintain primordium polarity by differential regulation of gene expression in the leading versus the trailing zone. Wnt/??-catenin signaling in leader cells informs coordinated migration via differential regulation of the two chemokine receptors, cxcr4b and cxcr7b. These findings uncover a molecular mechanism whereby a migrating tissue maintains stable, polarized gene expression domains despite periodic loss of whole groups of cells. Our findings also bear significance for cancer biology. Although the Fgf, Wnt/??-catenin, and chemokine signaling pathways are well known to be involved in cancer progression, these studies provide in??vivo evidence that these pathways are functionally linked. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Studying how individual cells spatially and temporally organize within the embryo is a fundamental issue in modern developmental biology to better understand the first stages of embryogenesis. In order to perform high-throughput analyses in three-dimensional microscopic images, it is essential to be able to automatically segment, classify and track cell nuclei. Many 3D/4D segmentation and tracking algorithms have been reported in the literature. Most of them are specific to particular models or acquisition systems and often require the fine tuning of parameters.RESULTS:We present a new automatic algorithm to segment and simultaneously classify cell nuclei in 3D/4D images. Segmentation relies on training samples that are interactively provided by the user and on an iterative thresholding process. This algorithm can correctly segment nuclei even when they are touching, and remains effective under temporal and spatial intensity variations. The segmentation is coupled to a classification of nuclei according to cell cycle phases, allowing biologists to quantify the effect of genetic perturbations and drug treatments. Robust 3D geometrical shape descriptors are used as training features for classification. Segmentation and classification results of three complete datasets are presented. In our working dataset of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, only 21 nuclei out of 3,585 were not detected, the overall F-score for segmentation reached 0.99, and more than 95{\%} of the nuclei were classified in the correct cell cycle phase. No merging of nuclei was found.CONCLUSION:We developed a novel generic algorithm for segmentation and classification in 3D images. The method, referred to as Adaptive Generic Iterative Thresholding Algorithm (AGITA), is freely available as an ImageJ plug-in.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In mammalian cells, the integrity of the primary cilium is critical for proper regulation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway. Whether or not this dependence on the primary cilium is a universal feature of vertebrate Hedgehog signalling has remained contentious due, in part, to the apparent divergence of the intracellular transduction pathway between mammals and teleost fish.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, using a functional Gli2-GFP fusion protein, we show that, as in mammals, the Gli2 transcription factor localizes to the primary cilia of cells in the zebrafish embryo and that this localization is modulated by the activity of the Hh pathway. Moreover, we show that the Igu/DZIP1protein, previously implicated in the modulation of Gli activity in zebrafish, also localizes to the primary cilium and is required for its proper formation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate a conserved role of the primary cilium in mediating Hedgehog signalling activity across the vertebrate phylum and validate the use of the zebrafish as a representative model for the in vivo analysis of vertebrate Hedgehog signalling.},

abstract = {Tissue morphogenesis and cell sorting are major forces during organ development. Here, we characterize the process of tissue morphogenesis within the zebrafish lateral line primordium, a migratory sheet of cells that gives rise to the neuromasts of the posterior lateral line organ. We find that cells within this epithelial tissue constrict actin-rich membranes and enrich apical junction proteins at apical focal points. The coordinated apical membrane constriction in single Delta D-positive hair cell progenitors and in their neighbouring prospective support cells generates cellular rosettes. Live imaging reveals that cellular rosettes subsequently separate from each other and give rise to individual neuromasts. Genetic analysis uncovers an involvement of Lethal giant larvae proteins in the maturation of apical junction belts during cellular rosette formation. Our findings suggest that apical constriction of cell membranes spatially confines regions of strong cell-cell adhesion and restricts the number of tightly interconnected cells into cellular rosettes, which ensures the correct deposition of neuromasts during morphogenesis of the posterior lateral line organ.},

abstract = {Two embryonic cell populations, the neural crest and cranial ectodermal placodes, between them give rise to many of the unique characters of vertebrates. Neurogenic placode derivatives are vital for sensing both external and internal stimuli. In this speculative review, we discuss potential developmental and evolutionary relationships between two placode series that are usually considered to be entirely independent: lateral line placodes, which form the mechanosensory and electroreceptive hair cells of the anamniote lateral line system as well as their afferent neurons, and epibranchial placodes (geniculate, petrosal and nodose), which form Phox2b(+) visceral sensory neurons with input from both the external and internal environment. We illustrate their development using molecular data we recently obtained in shark embryos, and we describe their derivatives, including the possible geniculate placode origin of a mechanosensory sense organ associated with the first pharyngeal pouch/cleft (the anamniote spiracular organ/amniote paratympanic organ). We discuss how both lateral line and epibranchial placodes can be related in different ways to the otic placode (which forms the inner ear and its afferent neurons), and how both are important for protective somatic reflexes. Finally, we put forward a highly speculative proposal about the original function of the cells whose evolutionary descendants today include the derivatives of the lateral line, otic and epibranchial placodes, namely that they produced sensory receptors and neurons for Phox2b-dependent protective reflex circuits. We hope this review will stimulate both debate and a fresh look at possible developmental and evolutionary relationships between these seemingly disparate and independent placodes.},

Here we combine optogenetic control of RhoA, live-cell imaging and traction force microscopy to investigate the dynamics of actomyosin-based force generation. Local activation of RhoA not only stimulates local recruitment of actin and myosin but also increased traction forces that rapidly propagate across the cell via stress fibres and drive increased actin flow. Surprisingly, this flow reverses direction when local RhoA activation stops. We identify zyxin as a regulator of stress fibre mechanics, as stress fibres are fluid-like without flow reversal in its absence. Using a physical model, we demonstrate that stress fibres behave elastic-like, even at timescales exceeding turnover of constituent proteins. Such molecular control of actin mechanics likely plays critical roles in regulating morphodynamic events.},

abstract = {Coordination of cell proliferation and cell death is essential to attain proper organ size during development and for maintaining tissue homeostasis throughout postnatal life. In Drosophila, these two processes are orchestrated by the Hippo kinase cascade, a growth-suppressive pathway that ultimately antagonizes the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Here we demonstrate that a single phosphorylation site in Yki mediates the growth-suppressive output of the Hippo pathway. Hippo-mediated phosphorylation inactivates Yki by excluding it from the nucleus, whereas loss of Hippo signaling leads to nuclear accumulation and therefore increased Yki activity. We further delineate a mammalian Hippo signaling pathway that culminates in the phosphorylation of YAP, the mammalian homolog of Yki. Using a conditional YAP transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the mammalian Hippo pathway is a potent regulator of organ size, and that its dysregulation leads to tumorigenesis. These results uncover a universal size-control mechanism in metazoan.},

abstract = {During mammalian development, the first two lineages to be specified are the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM). The Hippo pathway kinases Lats 1 and 2 (Lats1/2) and the transcriptional coactivator Yap play important roles in this specification process [1]. In outside cells of the embryo, Yap is nuclear localized and cooperates with Tead4 to induce the TE-specifying transcription factor Cdx2. In inside cells, Lats1/2 phosphorylate Yap and prevent its nuclear localization. The factors acting upstream of Lats1/2 and Yap in this context have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the upstream Hippo pathway member Nf2/Merlin is required for Lats1/2-dependent Yap phosphorylation in the preimplantation embryo. Injection of dominant-negative Nf2 mRNA causes Yap mislocalization and ectopic Cdx2 expression, effects that can be rescued by overexpression of Lats2 kinase. Zygotic Nf2 mutant blastocysts have mild defects in Yap localization and Cdx2 expression, but these become much more severe upon removal of both maternal and zygotic Nf2. The inside cells of maternal-zygotic mutants fail to establish a pluripotent ICM and form excess TE, resulting in peri-implantation lethality. Together, these data establish a clear role for Nf2 upstream of Yap in the preimplantation embryo and demonstrate that Hippo signaling is essential to segregate the ICM from the TE. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this Review we discuss the basic patterns that have been observed in time-series experiments, how these patterns are combined to form expression programs, and the computational analysis, visualization and integration of these data to infer models of dynamic biological systems.},

@article{Yang2015a,
abstract = {SignificanceThe control of organ growth involves cell-cell communication that is mediated by signal transduction pathways. The Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as an essential regulator of organ size in Drosophila and mammals, and defects in Hippo signaling drive cancer progression. An important unresolved question in the growth control field is, How is the Hippo pathway regulated? Recent reports show that adherens junctions and cell polarity complexes regulate the Hippo pathway, but controversy exists about the mechanisms involved. Here we report that in Drosophila and in mammalian cells, adherens junctions and basolateral polarity complexes regulate the Hippo pathway independently of each other. These results thus deepen our knowledge of this important growth control and tumor suppressor pathway. Adherens junctions (AJs) and cell polarity complexes are key players in the establishment and maintenance of apical-basal cell polarity. Loss of AJs or basolateral polarity components promotes tumor formation and metastasis. Recent studies in vertebrate models show that loss of AJs or loss of the basolateral component Scribble (Scrib) cause deregulation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway and hyperactivation of its downstream effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). However, whether AJs and Scrib act through the same or independent mechanisms to regulate Hippo pathway activity is not known. Here, we dissect how disruption of AJs or loss of basolateral components affect the activity of the Drosophila YAP homolog Yorkie (Yki) during imaginal disc development. Surprisingly, disruption of AJs and loss of basolateral proteins produced very different effects on Yki activity. Yki activity was cell-autonomously decreased but non-cell-autonomously elevated in tissues where the AJ components E-cadherin (E-cad) or -catenin (-cat) were knocked down. In contrast, scrib knockdown caused a predominantly cell-autonomous activation of Yki. Moreover, disruption of AJs or basolateral proteins had different effects on cell polarity and tissue size. Simultaneous knockdown of -cat and scrib induced both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous Yki activity. In mammalian cells, knockdown of E-cad or -cat caused nuclear accumulation and activation of YAP without overt effects on Scrib localization and vice versa. Therefore, our results indicate the existence of multiple, genetically separable inputs from AJs and cell polarity complexes into Yki/YAP regulation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. Cell fate determination by lateral inhibition via Notch/Delta signalling has been extensively studied. Most formalised models consider Notch/Delta interactions in fields of cells, with parameters that typically lead to symmetry breaking of signalling states between neighbouring cells, commonly resulting in salt-and-pepper fate patterns. Here, we consider the case of signalling between isolated cell pairs, and find that the bifurcation properties of a standard mathematical model of lateral inhibition can lead to stable symmetric signalling states. We apply this model to the adult intestinal stem cell (ISC) of Drosophila, the fate of which is stochastic but dependent on the Notch/Delta pathway. We observe a correlation between signalling state in cell pairs and their contact area. We interpret this behaviour in terms of the properties of our model in the presence of population variability in contact areas, which affects the effective signalling threshold of individual cells. Our results suggest that the dynamics of Notch/Delta signalling can contribute to explain stochasticity in stem cell fate decisions, and that the standard model for lateral inhibition can account for a wider range of developmental outcomes than previously considered.},

Since then, much evidence in various developmental systems has confirmed the importance of autocatalytic feedback loops combined with inhibitory interaction. Examples are found in the formation of embryonal organizing regions, in segmentation, in the polarization of individual cells, and in gene activation. By computer simulations, we have shown that the theory accounts for much of the regulatory phenomena observed, including signalling to regenerate removed parts. These self-regulatory features contribute to making development robust and error-tolerant. Furthermore, the resulting pattern is, to a large extent, independent of the details provided by initial conditions and inducing signals.},

abstract = {Correct organ size must involve a balance between promotion and inhibition of cell proliferation. A mathematical model has been proposed in which an organ is assumed to produce its own growth activator as well as a growth inhibitor [1], but there is as yet no molecular evidence to support this model [2]. The mechanosensory organs of the fish lateral line system (neuromasts) are composed of a core of sensory hair cells surrounded by nonsensory support cells. Sensory cells are constantly replaced and are regenerated from surrounding nonsensory cells [3], while each organ retains the same size throughout life. Moreover, neuromasts also bud off new neuromasts, which stop growing when they reach the same size [4, 5]. Here, we show that the size of neuromasts is controlled by a balance between growth-promoting Wnt signaling activity in proliferation- competent cells and Wnt-inhibiting Dkk activity produced by differentiated sensory cells. This negative feedback loop from Dkk (secreted by differentiated cells) on Wnt-dependent cell proliferation (in surrounding cells) also acts during regeneration to achieve size constancy. This study establishes Wnt/Dkk as a novel mechanism to determine the final size of an organ. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Apical constriction is a cell shape change that promotes epithelial bending. Activation of nonmuscle myosin II (Myo-II) by kinases such as Rho-associated kinase (Rok) is important to generate contractile force during apical constriction. Cycles of Myo-II assembly and disassembly, or pulses, are associated with apical constriction during Drosophila melanogaster gastrulation. It is not understood whether Myo-II phosphoregulation organizes contractile pulses or whether pulses are important for tissue morphogenesis. Here, we show that Myo-II pulses are associated with pulses of apical Rok. Mutants that mimic Myo-II light chain phosphorylation or depletion of myosin phosphatase inhibit Myo-II contractile pulses, disrupting both actomyosin coalescence into apical foci and cycles of Myo-II assembly/disassembly. Thus, coupling dynamic Myo-II phosphorylation to upstream signals organizes contractile Myo-II pulses in both space and time. Mutants that mimic Myo-II phosphorylation undergo continuous, rather than incremental, apical constriction. These mutants fail to maintain intercellular actomyosin network connections during tissue invagination, suggesting that Myo-II pulses are required for tissue integrity during morphogenesis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The discovery of the importance of proteins localized to cilia and basal bodies has provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of various human disorders including cystic kidney disease. The physiological role of cilium-generated signaling in most tissues including the kidney has remained elusive, however. This review focuses on the most recent advance in understanding a role for signaling through cilia for kidney biology. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work has tied the function of several developmental master regulators to cilium-generated signaling in vertebrates. Hedgehog signaling requires ciliary proteins and loss of targeting of its receptors and effectors to cilia abrogates Hedgehog function. Moreover, the ciliary protein inversin has been shown to act as a molecular switch for the regulation of Wnt signaling cascades. SUMMARY: Together with recent data on a function of cilia and basal body proteins in planar cell polarity in mice, a novel concept and testable hypothesis for the function of cilia in vertebrates is emerging: cilia may act as a cellular positioning device to allow subcellular asymmetry and polarization of the cells within the plane of the epithelium to develop and maintain regular arrays of cells such as kidney tubes.},

abstract = {Apical constriction (AC) is a widely utilized mechanism of cell shape change whereby epithelial cells transform from a cylindrical to conical shape, which can facilitate morphogenetic movements during embryonic development. Invertebrate epithelial cells undergoing AC depend on the contraction of apical cortex-spanning actomyosin filaments that generate force on the apical junctions and pull them toward the middle of the cell, effectively reducing the apical circumference. A current challenge is to determine whether these mechanisms are conserved in vertebrates and to identify the molecules responsible for linking apical junctions with the AC machinery. Utilizing the developing mouse eye as a model, we have uncovered evidence that lens placode AC may be partially dependent on apically positioned myosin-containing filaments associated with the zonula adherens. In addition we found that, among several junctional components, p120-catenin genetically interacts with Shroom3, a protein required for AC during embryonic morphogenesis. Further analysis revealed that, similar to Shroom3, p120-catenin is required for AC of lens cells. Finally, we determined that p120-catenin functions by recruiting Shroom3 to adherens junctions. Together, these data identify a novel role for p120-catenin during AC and further define the mechanisms required for vertebrate AC.},

Here we report CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of DNA cassettes into the zebrafish genome at a very high rate by homology-independent double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. After co-injection of a donor plasmid with a short guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 nuclease mRNA, concurrent cleavage of donor plasmid DNA and the selected chromosomal integration site resulted in efficient targeted integration of donor DNA. We successfully employed this approach to convert eGFP into Gal4 transgenic lines, and the same plasmids and sgRNAs can be applied in any species where eGFP lines were generated as part of enhancer and gene trap screens. In addition, we show the possibility of easily targeting DNA integration at endogenous loci, thus greatly facilitating the creation of reporter and loss-of-function alleles. Due to its simplicity, flexibility, and very high efficiency, our method greatly expands the repertoire for genome editing in zebrafish and can be readily adapted to many other organisms.},

abstract = {Although cells migrate in a constrained 3D environment in vivo, in-vitro studies have mainly focused on the analysis of cells moving on 2D substrates. Under such conditions, the Golgi complex is always located towards the leading edge of the cell, suggesting that it is involved in the directional movement. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this location can vary depending on the cell type, the environment or the developmental processes. We have used micro contact printing (microCP) to study the migration of cells that have a geometrically constrained shape within a polarized phenotype. Cells migrating on micropatterned lines of fibronectin are polarized and migrate in the same direction. Under such conditions, the Golgi complex and the centrosome are located behind the nucleus. In addition, the Golgi complex is often displaced several micrometres away from the nucleus. Finally, we used the zebrafish lateral line primordium as an in-vivo model of cells migrating in a constrained environment and observe a similar localization of both the Golgi and the centrosome in the leading cells. We propose that the positioning of the Golgi complex and the centrosome depends on the geometrical constraints applied to the cell rather than on a precise migratory function in the leading region.},

abstract = {A critical but molecularly uncharacterized step in heart formation and regeneration is the process that commits progenitor cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Here, we show that the endoderm-derived dual Nodal/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Cerberus-1 (Cer1) in embryonic stem cell cultures orchestrates two signaling pathways that direct the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to cardiomyogenic loci in multipotent (KDR/Flk1+) progenitors, activating lineage-specific transcription. Transient inhibition of Nodal by Cer1 induces Brahma-associated factor 60c (Baf60c), one of three Baf60 variants (a, b, and c) that are mutually exclusively assembled into SWI/SNF. Blocking Nodal and BMP also induces lineage-specific transcription factors Gata4 and Tbx5, which interact with Baf60c. siRNA to Cer1, Baf60c, or the catalytic SWI/SNF subunit Brg1 prevented the developmental opening of chromatin surrounding the Nkx2.5 early cardiac enhancer and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Overexpression of Baf60c fully rescued these deficits, positioning Baf60c and SWI/SNF function downstream from Cer1. Thus, antagonism of Nodal and BMP coordinates induction of the myogenic Baf60c variant and interacting transcription factors to program the developmental opening of cardiomyocyte-specific loci in chromatin. This is the first demonstration that cues from the progenitor cell environment direct the subunit variant composition of SWI/SNF to remodel the transcriptional landscape for lineage-specific differentiation.},

Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, ImageJ is at a critical development crossroads. We present ImageJ2, a total redesign of ImageJ offering a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. ImageJ2 provides a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs.},

Imaging the dynamics of tissue growth and morphogenesis is now possible with advances in time-lapse microscopy, but a true understanding of their complexities is limited by automated image analysis tools to extract quantitative data. To overcome such limitations, we have designed a new open-source image analysis toolkit called EpiTools. It provides user-friendly graphical user interfaces for accurately segmenting and tracking the contours of cell membrane signals obtained from 4D confocal imaging. It is designed for a broad audience, especially biologists with no computer-science background. Quantitative data extraction is integrated into a larger bioimaging platform, Icy, to increase the visibility and usability of our tools. We demonstrate the usefulness of EpiTools by analyzing Drosophila wing imaginal disc growth, revealing previously overlooked properties of this dynamic tissue, such as the patterns of cellular rearrangements.},

abstract = {Cranial placodes are specialized regions of the ectoderm, which give rise to various sensory ganglia and contribute to the pituitary gland and sensory organs of the vertebrate head. They include the adenohypophyseal, olfactory, lens, trigeminal, and profundal placodes, a series of epibranchial placodes, an otic placode, and a series of lateral line placodes. After a long period of neglect, recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in placode induction and specification. There is increasing evidence that all placodes despite their different developmental fates originate from a common panplacodal primordium around the neural plate. This common primordium is defined by the expression of transcription factors of the Six1/2, Six4/5, and Eya families, which later continue to be expressed in all placodes and appear to promote generic placodal properties such as proliferation, the capacity for morphogenetic movements, and neuronal differentiation. A large number of other transcription factors are expressed in subdomains of the panplacodal primordium and appear to contribute to the specification of particular subsets of placodes. This review first provides a brief overview of different cranial placodes and then synthesizes evidence for the common origin of all placodes from a panplacodal primordium. The role of various transcription factors for the development of the different placodes is addressed next, and it is discussed how individual placodes may be specified and compartmentalized within the panplacodal primordium. Finally, tissues and signals involved in placode induction are summarized with a special focus on induction of the panplacodal primordium itself (generic placode induction) and its relation to neural induction and neural crest induction. Integrating current data, new models of generic placode induction and of combinatorial placode specification are presented. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The VAST BioImager automates larval handling, positioning and orientation tasks. Color images at about 10 $\mu$m resolution are collected from the on-board camera of the system. If images of greater resolution and detail are required, this system is mounted on an upright microscope, such as a confocal or fluorescence microscope, to utilize their capabilities. The system loads a larvae, positions it in view of the camera, determines orientation using pattern recognition analysis, and then more precisely positions to user-defined orientation for optimal imaging of any desired tissue or organ system. Multiple images of the same larva can be collected. The specific part of each larva and the desired orientation and position is identified by the researcher and an experiment defining the settings and a series of steps can be saved and repeated for imaging of subsequent larvae. The system captures images, then ejects and loads another larva from either a bulk reservoir, a well of a 96 well plate using the LP Sampler, or individually targeted larvae from a Petri dish or other container using the VAST Pipettor. Alternative manual protocols for handling larvae for image collection are tedious and time consuming. The VAST BioImager automates these steps to allow for greater throughput of assays and screens requiring high-content image collection of zebrafish larvae such as might be used in drug discovery and toxicology studies.},

abstract = {The posterior lateral line primordium (pLLp) migrates caudally, depositing neuromasts to establish the posterior lateral line system in zebrafish. A Wnt-dependent FGF signaling center at the leading end of the pLLp initiates the formation of `proneuromasts' by facilitating the reorganization of cells into epithelial rosettes and by initiating atoh1a expression. Expression of atoh1a gives proneuromast cells the potential to become sensory hair cells, and lateral inhibition mediated by Delta-Notch signaling restricts atoh1a expression to a central cell. We show that as atoh1a expression becomes established in the central cell, it drives expression of fgf10 and of the Notch ligand deltaD, while it inhibits expression of fgfr1. As a source of Fgf10, the central cell activates the FGF pathway in neighboring cells, ensuring that they form stable epithelial rosettes. At the same time, DeltaD activates Notch in neighboring cells, inhibiting atoh1a expression and ensuring that they are specified as supporting cells. When Notch signaling fails, unregulated atoh1a expression reduces Fgfr1 expression, eventually resulting in attenuated FGF signaling, which prevents effective maturation of epithelial rosettes in the pLLp. In addition, atoh1a inhibits e-cadherin expression, which is likely to reduce cohesion and contribute to fragmentation of the pLLp. Together, our observations reveal a genetic regulatory network that explains why atoh1a expression must be restricted by Notch signaling for effective morphogenesis of the pLLp.},

abstract = {Summarizing a set of sequences is an old topic that has been revived in the last decade, due to the increasing availability of sequential datasets. The definition of a consensus object is on the center of data analysis issues, since it crystallizes the underlying organization of the data. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is currently the most relevant similarity measure between sequences for a large panel of applications, since it makes it possible to capture temporal distortions. In this context, averaging a set of sequences is not a trivial task, since the average sequence has to be consistent with this similarity measure. The Steiner theory and several works in computational biology have pointed out the connection between multiple alignments and average sequences. Taking inspiration from these works, we introduce the notion of compact multiple alignment, which allows us to link these theories to the problem of summarizing under time warping. Having defined the link between the multiple alignment and the average sequence, the second part of this article focuses on the scan of the space of compact multiple alignments in order to provide an average sequence of a set of sequences. We propose to use a genetic algorithm based on a specific representation of the genotype inspired by genes. This representation of the genotype makes it possible to consistently paint the fitness landscape. Experiments carried out on standard datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional lateralization is a conserved feature of the central nervous system (CNS). However, underlying left-right asymmetries within neural circuitry and the mechanisms by which they develop are poorly described.

RESULTS: In this study, we use focal electroporation to examine the morphology and connectivity of individual neurons of the lateralized habenular nuclei. Habenular projection neurons on both sides of the brain share a stereotypical unipolar morphology and elaborate remarkable spiraling terminal arbors in their target interpeduncular nucleus, a morphology unlike that of any other class of neuron described to date. There are two quite distinct sub-types of axon arbor that differ both in branching morphology and in their localization within the target nucleus. Critically, both arbor morphologies are elaborated by both left and right-sided neurons, but at greatly differing frequencies. We show that these differences in cell type composition account for the gross connectional asymmetry displayed by the left and right habenulae. Analysis of the morphology and projections of individual post-synaptic neurons suggests that the target nucleus has the capacity to either integrate left and right inputs or to handle them independently, potentially relaying information from the left and right habenulae within distinct downstream pathways, thus preserving left-right coding. Furthermore, we find that signaling from the unilateral, left-sided parapineal nucleus is necessary for both left and right axons to develop arbors with appropriate morphology and targeting. However, following parapineal ablation, left and right habenular neurons continue to elaborate arbors with distinct, lateralized morphologies.

CONCLUSION: By taking the analysis of asymmetric neural circuitry to the level of single cells, we have resolved left-right differences in circuit microarchitecture and show that lateralization can be recognized at the level of the morphology and connectivity of single projection neuron axons. Crucially, the same circuitry components are specified on both sides of the brain, but differences in the ratios of different neuronal sub-types results in a lateralized neural architecture and gross connectional asymmetry. Although signaling from the parapineal is essential for the development of normal lateralization, additional factors clearly act during development to confer left-right identity upon neurons in this highly conserved circuit.},

We show that Notch signaling acts downstream of Fgf signaling to not only inhibit hair cell differentiation but also to induce and maintain stable epithelial rosettes. Ectopic Notch expression causes a significant increase in organ size independently of proliferation and the Hippo pathway. Transplantation and RNASeq analyses revealed that Notch signaling induces apical junctional complex genes that regulate cell adhesion and apical constriction.

abstract = {Epithelial invagination is a common feature of embryogenesis. An example of invagination morphogenesis occurs during development of the early eye when the lens placode forms the lens pit. This morphogenesis is accompanied by a columnar-to-conical cell shape change (apical constriction or AC) and is known to be dependent on the cytoskeletal protein Shroom3. Because Shroom3-induced AC can be Rock1/2 dependent, we hypothesized that during lens invagination, RhoA, Rock and a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoA-GEF) would also be required. In this study, we show that Rock activity is required for lens pit invagination and that RhoA activity is required for Shroom3-induced AC. We demonstrate that RhoA, when activated and targeted apically, is sufficient to induce AC and that RhoA plays a key role in Shroom3 apical localization. Furthermore, we identify Trio as a RhoA-GEF required for Shroom3-dependent AC in MDCK cells and in the lens pit. Collectively, these data indicate that a Trio-RhoA-Shroom3 pathway is required for AC during lens pit invagination.},

abstract = {Light sheet microscopy techniques, such as selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), are ideally suited for time-lapse imaging of developmental processes lasting several hours to a few days. The success of this promising technology has mainly been limited by the lack of suitable techniques for mounting fragile samples. Embedding zebrafish embryos in agarose, which is common in conventional confocal microscopy, has resulted in severe growth defects and unreliable results. In this study, we systematically quantified the viability and mobility of zebrafish embryos mounted under more suitable conditions. We found that tubes made of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) filled with low concentrations of agarose or methylcellulose provided an optimal balance between sufficient confinement of the living embryo in a physiological environment over 3 days and optical clarity suitable for fluorescence imaging. We also compared the effect of different concentrations of Tricaine on the development of zebrafish and provide guidelines for its optimal use depending on the application. Our results will make light sheet microscopy techniques applicable to more fields of developmental biology, in particular the multiview long-term imaging of zebrafish embryos and other small organisms. Furthermore, the refinement of sample preparation for in toto and in vivo imaging will promote other emerging optical imaging techniques, such as optical projection tomography (OPT).},

abstract = {We observe and quantify wave-like characteristics of amoeboid migration. Using the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a model system for the study of chemotaxis, we demonstrate that cell shape changes in a wave-like manner. Cells have regions of high boundary curvature that propagate from the leading edge toward the back, usually along alternating sides of the cell. Curvature waves are easily seen in cells that do not adhere to a surface, such as cells that are electrostatically repelled from surfaces or cells that extend over the edge of micro-fabricated cliffs. Without surface contact, curvature waves travel from the leading edge to the back of a cell at -35 µm/min. Non-adherent myosin II null cells do not exhibit these curvature waves. At the leading edge of adherent cells, curvature waves are associated with protrusive activity. Like regions of high curvature, protrusive activity travels along the boundary in a wave-like manner. Upon contact with a surface, the protrusions stop moving relative to the surface, and the boundary shape thus reflects the history of protrusive motion. The wave-like character of protrusions provides a plausible mechanism for the zig-zagging of pseudopods and for the ability of cells both to swim in viscous fluids and to navigate complex three dimensional topography.},

abstract = {Cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial to cell physiology such as polarity, motility, and proliferation. In normal cells, loss of attachment to the ECM induces a specific type of apoptosis, termed anoikis. Resistance to anoikis in cancer cells promotes their survival in circulation and dispersion to distant anatomic sites, leading to tumor metastasis. The Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcription coactivator is a human oncogene and a key regulator of organ size. The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway phosphorylates and inhibits YAP. However, little is known about the signals that regulate the Hippo pathway. Here we report that through cytoskeleton reorganization, cell detachment activates the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 and leads to YAP phosphorylation and inhibition. The detachment-induced YAP inactivation is required for anoikis in nontransformed cells, whereas in cancer cells with deregulation of the Hippo pathway, knockdown of YAP and TAZ restores anoikis. Furthermore, we provided evidence that Lats1/2 expression level is indeed significantly down-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer. Our findings provide a novel connection between cell attachment and anoikis through the Hippo pathway and have important implications in cancer therapeutics.},

abstract = {Directional collective migration is now a widely recognized mode of migration during embryogenesis and cancer. However, how a cluster of cells responds to chemoattractants is not fully understood. Neural crest cells are among the most motile cells in the embryo, and their behavior has been likened to malignant invasion. Here, we show that neural crest cells are collectively attracted toward the chemokine Sdf1. While not involved in initially polarizing cells, Sdf1 directionally stabilizes cell protrusions promoted by cell contact. At this cell contact, N-cadherin inhibits protrusion and Rac1 activity and in turn promotes protrusions and activation of Rac1 at the free edge. These results show a role for N-cadherin during contact inhibition of locomotion, and they reveal a mechanism of chemoattraction likely to function during both embryogenesis and cancer metastasis, whereby attractants such as Sdf1 amplify and stabilize contact-dependent cell polarity, resulting in directional collective migration. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Nuclear movements play an essential role in metazoan development. Although the intracellular transport mechanisms underlying nuclear movements have been studied in detail, relatively little is known about signals from surrounding cells and tissues controlling these movements. Here, we show that, in gastrulating zebrafish embryos, convergence movements of nuclei within the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) are guided by mesoderm and endoderm progenitors migrating along the surface of the yolk towards the dorsal side of the developing gastrula. Progenitor cells direct the convergence movements of internal yolk syncytial nuclei (iYSN) by modulating cortical flow within the YSL in which the iYSN are entrained. The effect of mesoderm and endoderm progenitors on the convergence movement of iYSN depends on the expression of E-cadherin, indicating that adhesive contact between the cells and the YSL is required for the mesendoderm-modulated YSL cortical flow mediating nuclear convergence. In summary, our data reveal a crucial function for cortical flow in the coordination of syncytial nuclear movements with surrounding cells and tissues during zebrafish gastrulation.},

The Drosophila mats gene functions in the Hippo signaling pathway to control tissue growth by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, nothing is known about whether mats family genes are required for the normal development of vertebrates. Here we report that zebrafish has three mats family genes. Expression of mats1 is maternally activated and continues during embryogenesis. Through a morpholino-based knockdown approach, we found that mats1 is required for normal embryonic development. Reduction of mats1 function caused developmental delay, a phenotype similar to that of Drosophila mats homozygous mutants. Both cell proliferation and apoptosis were defective in mats1 morphant embryos. Moreover, mats1 morphant cells exhibited a growth advantage in chimeric embryos, similar to mats mutant cells in mosaic tissues in Drosophila. Therefore mats1 plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis during early development in zebrafish, and the role of mats family genes in growth regulation is conserved in both invertebrates and vertebrates. This work shows that zebrafish can be a good model organism for further analysis of Hippo signaling pathway.},

The physiological significance of primary cilia is underscored by the fact that defects in assembly or function of these organelles lead to a range of severe diseases and developmental disorders. In most cell types of the human body, signaling by primary cilia involves different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which transmit specific signals to the cell through G proteins to regulate diverse cellular and physiological events. Here, we provide an overview of GPCR signaling in primary cilia, with main focus on the rhodopsin-like (class A) and the smoothened/frizzled (class F) GPCRs. We describe how such recep- tors dynamically traffic into and out of the ciliary compartment and how they interact with other classes of ciliary GPCRs, such as class B receptors, to control ciliary function and various physiologi- cal and behavioral processes. Finally, we discuss future avenues for developing GPCR-targeted drug strategies for the treatment of ciliopathies},

abstract = {Rhythmic and sequential subdivision of the elongating vertebrate embryonic body axis into morphological somites is controlled by an oscillating multicellular genetic network termed the segmentation clock. This clock operates in the presomitic mesoderm " PSM{\ldots}, generating dynamic stripe patterns of oscillatory gene-expression across the field of PSM cells. How these spatial patterns, the clock's collective period, and the underlying cellular-level interactions are related is not understood. A theory encompassing temporal and spatial domains of local and collective aspects of the system is essential to tackle these questions. Our delayed coupling theory achieves this by representing the PSM as an array of phase oscillators, combining four key elements: a frequency profile of oscillators slowing across the PSM; coupling between neighboring oscillators; delay in coupling; and a moving boundary describing embryonic axis elongation. This theory predicts that the segmentation clock's collective period depends on delayed coupling. We derive an expression for pattern wavelength across the PSM and show how this can be used to fit dynamic wildtype gene-expression patterns, revealing the quantitative values of parameters controlling spatial and temporal organization of the oscillators in the system. Our theory can be used to analyze experimental perturbations, thereby identifying roles of genes involved in segmentation.},

MZovl mutants display normal canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling but show defects in Hh signaling. As in mouse, zebrafish cilia are required to mediate the activities of Hh, Ptc, Smo and PKA. However, in contrast to mouse Ift88 mutants, which show a dramatic reduction in Hh signaling, zebrafish MZovl mutants display dampened, but expanded, Hh pathway activity. This activity is largely due to gli1, the expression of which is fully dependent on Hh signaling in mouse but not in zebrafish. These results reveal a conserved requirement for cilia in transducing the activity of upstream regulators of Hh signaling but distinct phenotypic effects due to differential regulation and differing roles of transcriptional mediators.},

We describe genes that are required by wild-type cells to kill Minute neighbors in Drosophila. The engulfment genes draper, wasp, the phosphatidylserine receptor, mbc/dock180, and rac1 are needed in wild-type cells for the death of Minute neighbors, whose corpses are engulfed by wild-type cells. Wild-type cells can themselves be killed by cells with elevated engulfing activity. Thus engulfment genes act downstream of growth differences between cells to eliminate cells with reduced ribosomal gene dose. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most epithelial cells, besides their ubiquitous apical-basal polarity, are polarized within the plane of the epithelium, which is called planar cell polarity (PCP). Using Drosophila as a model, meaningful progress has been made in the identification of key PCP factors and the dissection of their intracellular molecular interactions. The long-range, global aspects of coordinated polarization and the overlying regulatory mechanisms that create the initial polarity direction have, however, remained elusive. Several recent publications have outlined potential mechanisms of how the global regulation of PCP might be controlled and how the distinct core factor groups might interact via frizzled, Van Gogh or flamingo. This review focuses on these exciting features and attempts to provide an integrated picture of these recent and novel insights. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the present study, a zebrafish hsp27 promoter was isolated and used to develop heat shock inducible gfp transgenic zebrafish. The endogenous hsp27 mRNAs were constitutively expressed from 4??hpf and increased in several regions of brain, heart and somites in early embryogenesis until 24??hpf. Subsequently, the expression was reduced significantly but maintained in the heart and ears. Heat shock induced hsp27 mRNAs in the blastoderm from 6??hpf and later in somites, branchial arches and several regions of brain. Similarly in hsp27-gfp transgenic zebrafish, constitutive GFP expression was observed from 11??hpf. GFP expression was mainly in the skin cells and increased to the peak level at 7??dpf, followed by a reduction. The constitutive GFP expression in the heart was initiated from 50??hpf and maintained even in the adult fish. After heat shock, GFP expression was mainly induced in the muscle in addition to a mild increase in the skin and heart. The early stages of the embryos were more sensitive than late stages as the time required for induced GFP expression in the muscle is shorter. Thus, the hsp27-gfp transgenic line generally recapitulates the expression pattern and heat shock inducibility of endogenous hsp27 RNAs. We also tested the potential of using the hsp27-gfp transgenic zebrafish embryos for heavy metal induction and demonstrated the inducibility of GFP expression by arsenic; this pattern of induction was also supported by examination of endogenous hsp27 mRNA. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The posterior lateral line primordium (PLLp) migrates caudally and periodically deposits neuromasts. Coupled, but mutually inhibitory, Wnt-FGF signaling systems regulate proto-neuromast formation in the PLLp: FGF ligands expressed in response to Wnt signaling activate FGF receptors and initiate proto-neuromast formation. FGF receptor signaling, in turn, inhibits Wnt signaling. However, mechanisms that determine periodic neuromast formation and deposition in the PLLp remain poorly understood. Previous studies showed that neuromasts are deposited closer together and the PLLp terminates prematurely in lef1-deficient zebrafish embryos. It was suggested that this results from reduced proliferation in the leading domain of the PLLp and/or premature incorporation of progenitors into proto-neuromasts. We found that rspo3 knockdown reduces proliferation in a manner similar to that seen in lef1 morphants. However, it does not cause closer neuromast deposition or premature termination of the PLLp, suggesting that such changes in lef1-deficient embryos are not linked to changes in proliferation. Instead, we suggest that they are related to the role of Lef1 in regulating the balance of Wnt and FGF functions in the PLLp. Lef1 determines expression of the FGF signaling inhibitor Dusp6 in leading cells and regulates incorporation of cells into neuromasts; reduction of Dusp6 in leading cells in lef1-deficient embryos allows new proto-neuromasts to form closer to the leading edge. This is associated with progressively slower PLLp migration, reduced spacing between deposited neuromasts and premature termination of the PLLp system.},

abstract = {The Hippo pathway senses cell density information to control tissue growth by regulating the localization of the transcriptional regulators TAZ and YAP (TAZ/YAP). TAZ/YAP also regulate TGF-$\beta$-SMAD signaling, but whether this role is linked to cell density sensing is unknown. Here we demonstrate that TAZ/YAP dictate the localization of active SMAD complexes in response to cell density-mediated formation of polarity complexes. In high-density cell cultures, the Hippo pathway drives cytoplasmic localization of TAZ/YAP, which sequesters SMAD complexes, thereby suppressing TGF-$\beta$ signaling. We show that during mouse embryogenesis, this is reflected by differences in TAZ/YAP localization, which define regions of active SMAD2/3 complexes. Interfering with TAZ/YAP phosphorylation drives nuclear accumulation of TAZ/YAP and SMAD2/3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Crumbs polarity complex interacts with TAZ/YAP, which relays cell density information by promoting TAZ/YAP phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention, and suppressed TGF-$\beta$ signaling. Accordingly, disruption of the Crumbs complex enhances TGF-$\beta$ signaling and predisposes cells to TGF-$\beta$-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The generation of zebrafish transgenic lines that express specific fluorophores in a cell- or tissue-specific manner is an important technique that takes full advantage of the optical clarity of the embryo. Identifying promoter fragments that faithfully recapitulate endogenous expression patterns and levels is often difficult and using large genomic DNA fragments, such as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), makes the process of transgenesis less reliable. Here we provide a detailed protocol that allows for BAC selection and subsequent rapid modification through recombineering in Escherichia coli, resulting in BACs that can be injected into zebrafish embryos and, aided by tol2-mediated transgenesis, reliably yield stable transgenic lines. A number of BACs can be prepared in parallel, and injection of the BACs containing CFP/YFP/RFP or Gal4 cassettes allows for immediate testing of whether a particular BAC will yield the desired result. Furthermore, since injected embryos often show widespread expression, recombineered BACs provide an alternative to two-color in situ hybridizations: BACs injected into embryos of a different transgenic reporter line thus enable in vivo colocalization studies. Using this protocol, we have generated 66 stable lines for 23 different genes, with an average transgenesis rate above 10{\%}. Importantly, we provide evidence that BAC size shows no apparent correlation to the transgenesis rate achieved and that there are no severe position effects.},

This border region develops through a series of inductive interactions that begins before gastrulation and progressively divide embryonic ectoderm into neural and non-neural regions, followed by the emergence of neural crest and placodal progenitors. In this review, we describe how a limited repertoire of inductive signals-principally FGFs, Wnts and BMPs-set up domains of transcription factors in the border region which establish these progenitor territories by both cross-inhibitory and cross-autoregulatory interactions. The gradual assembly of different cohorts of transcription factors that results from these interactions is one mechanism to provide the competence to respond to inductive signals in different ways, ultimately generating the neural crest and cranial placodes.},

Here we describe an alternative mechanism for tissue contraction, based on individual cell volume change. We show that during Drosophila dorsal closure (DC), a wound healing-related process, the contraction of the amnioserosa (AS) is associated with a major reduction of the volume of its cells, triggered by caspase activation at the onset of the apoptotic program of AS cells. Cell volume decrease results in a contractile force that promotes tissue shrinkage. Estimating mechanical tensions with laser dissection and using 3D biophysical modeling, we show that the cell volume decrease acts together with the contraction of the actin cable surrounding the tissue to govern DC kinetics. Our study identifies a mechanism by which tissues generate forces and movements by modulating individual cell volume during development.},

abstract = {Background: The zebrafish has been established as the main vertebrate model system for whole organism screening applications. However, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays. While technical solutions to the orientation problem exist, dissemination is often hindered by the lack of simple and inexpensive ways of distributing and duplicating tools. Results: Here, we provide a cost effective method for the production of 96-well plate compatible zebrafish orientation tools using a desktop 3D printer. The printed tools enable the positioning and orientation of zebrafish embryos within cavities formed in agarose. Their applicability is demonstrated by acquiring lateral and dorsal views of zebrafish embryos arrayed within microtiter plates using an automated screening microscope. This enables the consistent visualization of morphological phenotypes and reporter gene expression patterns. Conclusions: The designs are refined versions of previously demonstrated devices with added functionality and strongly reduced production costs. All corresponding 3D models are freely available and digital design can be easily shared electronically. In combination with the increasingly widespread usage of 3D printers, this provides access to the developed tools to a wide range of zebrafish users. Finally, the design files can serve as templates for other additive and subtractive fabrication methods.},

Our discussions aim to highlight the immensely complex regulatory mechanisms that encompass Rho GTPase signaling during AB polarization. More specifically, in this review we discuss several emerging common themes, that include: 1) the need for Rho GTPase activities to be carefully balanced in both a spatial and temporal manner through a multitude of mechanisms; 2) the existence of signaling feedback loops and crosstalk to create robust cellular responses; and 3) the frequent multifunctionality that exists among AB polarity regulators. Regarding this latter theme, we provide further discussion of the potential plasticity of the cell polarity machinery and as a result the possible implications for human disease.},

abstract = {Heart function requires sophisticated regulatory networks to orchestrate organ development, physiological responses, and environmental adaptation. Until recently, it was thought that these regulatory networks are composed solely of protein-mediated transcriptional control and signaling systems; consequently, it was thought that cardiac disease involves perturbation of these systems. However, it is becoming evident that RNA, long considered to function primarily as the platform for protein production, may in fact play a major role in most, if not all, aspects of gene regulation, especially the epigenetic processes that underpin organogenesis. These include not only well-validated classes of regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs, but also tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed across the entire genome of humans and other animals. Here, we review this emerging landscape, summarizing what is known about their functions and their role in cardiac biology, and provide a toolkit to assist in exploring this previously hidden layer of gene regulation that may underpin heart adaptation and complex heart diseases.},

Intercellular adhesions share the complex task of establishing and maintaining tissue architecture while allowing tissue growth, renewal and repair. In particular, adherens junctions (AJs) have been implicated in the formation of diverse tissues and organs like epitheliums, blood vessels or the central nervous system. At the cellular level, AJs are well known for their essential role in epithelial cell differentiation and baso-apical polarity. They also contribute to the control of cell polarity to promote neuronal morphogenesis, growth cone guidance and directed migration in a variety of cell types during embryonic development. AJs based on classical cadherin- and nectin-mediated cell-cell interactions control local membrane dynamics to polarize cell morphology and motility at the single cell level and to coordinate cell shape changes and motile behaviour at the tissue level. I review here the molecular mechanisms allowing control of polarized cell morphology and motility by AJs. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {FoxG1 is an evolutionarily conserved, winged-helix transcriptional repressor that maintains progenitor cells in the vertebrate forebrain. How the activity of FoxG1 is regulated is not known. Here, we report that in the developing Xenopus and mouse forebrain, FoxG1 is nuclear in progenitor cells but cytoplasmic in differentiating cells. The subcellular localisation of FoxG1 is regulated at the post-translational level by casein kinase I (CKI) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling. CKI phosphorylation of Ser 19 of FoxG1 promotes nuclear import, whereas FGF-induced phosphorylation of Thr 226 promotes nuclear export. Interestingly, FGF-induced phosphorylation of FoxG1 is mediated Akt kinase (also known as protein B kinase, PKB) kinase, rather than the MAPK pathway. Phosphorylation of endogenous FoxG1 is blocked by CKI and Akt inhibitors. In the mouse olfactory placode cell line OP27, and in cortical progenitors, increased FGF signalling causes FoxG1 to exit the nucleus and promotes neuronal differentiation, whereas FGF and Akt inhibitors block this effect. Thus, CKI and FGF signalling converge on an antagonistic regulation of FoxG1, which in turn controls neurogenesis in the forebrain.},

Live-cell imaging experiments carried out to this end often produce massive amounts of time-lapse image data containing far more information than can be digested by a human observer. Computerized image analysis offers the potential to take full advantage of available data in an efficient and reproducible manner. A recurring task in many experiments is the tracking of large numbers of cells or particles and the analysis of their (morpho)dynamic behavior. In the past decade, many methods have been developed for this purpose, and software tools based on these are increasingly becoming available. Here, we survey the latest developments in this area and discuss the various computational approaches, software tools, and quantitative measures for tracking and motion analysis of cells and particles in time-lapse microscopy images.},

abstract = {Cell shape changes require the coordination of actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The molecular mechanisms by which such coordination is achieved remain obscure, particularly in the context of epithelial cells within developing vertebrate embryos. We have identified a novel role for the actin-binding protein Shroom3 as a regulator of the microtubule cytoskeleton during epithelial morphogenesis. We show that Shroom3 is sufficient and also necessary to induce a redistribution of the microtubule regulator gamma-tubulin. Moreover, this change in gamma-tubulin distribution underlies the assembly of aligned arrays of microtubules that drive apicobasal cell elongation. Finally, experiments with the related protein, Shroom1, demonstrate that gamma-tubulin regulation is a conserved feature of this protein family. Together, the data demonstrate that Shroom family proteins govern epithelial cell behaviors by coordinating the assembly of both microtubule and actin cytoskeletons.},

Forward genetic analysis via chemical mutagenesis screening has established a variety of zebrafish mutants that are defective in various types of organogenesis, and the genes responsible for the individual mutants have been identified from genome mapping. On the other hand, reverse genetic analysis via targeted gene disruption using embryonic stem (ES) cells (e.g., knockout mouse) can uncover gene functions by investigating the phenotypic effects. However, this approach is mostly limited to mice among the vertebrate models because of the difficulty in establishing ES cells. Recently, new gene targeting technologies, such as the transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 systems, have been developed: that can directly introduce genome modifications at the targeted genomic locus. Here, we summarize these new and powerful genome editing techniques for the study of zebrafish.},

abstract = {Tissue regeneration is vital to the form and function of an organ. At the core of an organs' ability to self-renew is the stem cell, which maintains homeostasis, and repopulates injured or aged tissue. Tissue damage can dramatically change the dimensions of an organ, and during regeneration, an organ must halt growth once the original tissue dimensions have been restored. Therefore, stem cells must give rise to the appropriate number of differentiated progeny to achieve homeostasis. How this tissue-size checkpoint is regulated and how tissue size information relayed to stem cell compartments is unclear, however, it is likely that these mechanisms are altered during the course of tumorigenesis. An emerging signaling cascade, the Hippo Signaling Pathway, is a broadly conserved potent organ size regulator [1]. However, this pathway does not act alone. A number of examples demonstrate crosstalk between Hippo and other signaling pathways including Wnt, Tgfb and Notch, with implications for stem cell biology. Here, we focus on these interactions primarily in the context of well characterized stem cell populations.},

Tracking cells in datasets affected by drift and/or growth will incorporate these movements into any analysis of cell position. This may result in the apparent movement of static structures within the sample. Therefore prior to cell tracking, any sample drift should be corrected. Using the open source Fiji distribution (1)  of ImageJ (2,3) and the incorporated LOCI tools (4), we developed the Correct 3D drift plug-in to remove erroneous sample movement in confocal datasets. This protocol effectively compensates for sample translation or alterations in focal position by utilizing phase correlation to register each time-point of a four-dimensional confocal datasets while maintaining the ability to visualize and measure cell movements over extended time-lapse experiments.},

@article{Wehman2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cells release extracellular vesicles (ECVs) that can influence differentiation, modulate the immune response, promote coagulation, and induce metastasis. Many ECVs form by budding outwards from the plasma membrane, but the molecules that regulate budding are unknown. In ECVs, the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer contains aminophospholipids that are normally sequestered to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, suggesting a role for lipid asymmetry in ECV budding. RESULTS: We show that loss of the conserved P4-ATPase TAT-5 causes the large-scale shedding of ECVs and disrupts cell adhesion and morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. TAT-5 localizes to the plasma membrane and its loss results in phosphatidylethanolamine exposure on cell surfaces. We show that RAB-11 and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins, which regulate the topologically analogous process of viral budding, are enriched at the plasma membrane in tat-5 embryos, and are required for ECV production. CONCLUSIONS: TAT-5 is the first protein identified to regulate ECV budding. TAT-5 provides a potential molecular link between loss of phosphatidylethanolamine asymmetry and the dynamic budding of vesicles from the plasma membrane, supporting the hypothesis that lipid asymmetry regulates budding. Our results also suggest that viral budding and ECV budding may share common molecular mechanisms.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis is a fascinating but complex and incompletely understood developmental process. The sensory lateral line system consists of only a few hundred cells and is experimentally accessible making it an excellent model system to interrogate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying segmental morphogenesis. The posterior lateral line primordium periodically deposits prosensory organs as it migrates to the tail tip. We demonstrate that periodic proneuromast deposition is governed by a fundamentally different developmental mechanism than the classical models of developmental periodicity represented by vertebrate somitogenesis and early Drosophila development. Our analysis demonstrates that proneuromast deposition is driven by periodic lengthening of the primordium and a stable Wnt/??-catenin activation domain in the leading region of the primordium. The periodic lengthening of the primordium is controlled by Wnt/??-catenin/Fgf-dependent proliferation. Once proneuromasts are displaced into the trailing Wnt/??-catenin-free zone they are deposited. We have previously shown that Wnt/??-catenin signaling induces Fgf signaling and that interactions between these two pathways regulate primordium migration and prosensory organ formation. Therefore, by coordinating migration, prosensory organ formation and proliferation, localized activation of Wnt/??-catenin signaling in the leading zone of the primordium plays a crucial role in orchestrating lateral line morphogenesis. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The best described brain asymmetries are found in the diencephalic epithalamus, where the habenulae and the dorso-laterally adjacent pineal complex are lateralized in many species. Research in the past decade has shed light on the establishment of the laterality of these structures as well as their asymmetry per se. In particular work in zebrafish (Danio rerio) has substantially contributed to our understanding, which genetic pathways are involved in these processes. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has turned out to play a pivotal role in the regulation of brain laterality and asymmetry and acts reiteratively during embryonic development.},

abstract = {Throughout development, tissues exhibit dynamic cell deformation, which is characterized by the integration of cell boundary contraction and/or elongation. Such changes ultimately establish tissue morphology and function [1–5]. In comparison to cell boundary contraction, which is predominantly driven by non-muscle myosin II (MyoII)-dependent contraction [6–9], the mechanisms of cell boundary elongation remain elusive. We explored the dynamics of the amnioserosa, which is known to exhibit cell shape oscillation [10–15], as a model system to study the subcellular-level mechanics that spatiotemporally evolve during Drosophila dorsal closure. Here we show that cell boundary elongation occurs through a combination of a non-autonomous active process and an autonomous process. The former is driven by a transient change in the level of MyoII in the neighboring cells that pull the vertices, whereas the latter is governed by the relaxation of junctional tension. By monitoring cell boundary deformation during live imaging, junctional tension at the specific phase of cell boundary oscillation, e.g., contraction or elongation, was probed by laser ablation. Junctional tension during boundary elongation is lower than during the other phase of oscillation. We extended our tension measurements to non-invasively estimate a tension map across the tissue, and found a correlation between junctional tension and vinculin dynamics at the cell junction. We propose that the medial actomyosin network is used as an entity to both contract and elongate the cell boundary. Moreover, our findings raise a possibility that the level of vinculin at the cell boundary could be used to approximate junctional tension in vivo.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Degeneration or loss of inner ear hair cells (HCs) is irreversible and results in sensorineural hearing loss (SHL). Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have been employed in disease modelling and cell therapy. Here, we propose a transcription factor (TF)-driven approach using ATOH1 and regulatory factor of x-box (RFX) genes to generate HC-like cells from hiPSCs. Our results suggest that ATOH1/RFX1/RFX3 could significantly increase the differentiation capacity of iPSCs into MYO7A mCherry -positive cells, upregulate the mRNA expression levels of HC-related genes and promote the differentiation of HCs with more mature stereociliary bundles. To model the molecular and stereociliary structural changes involved in HC dysfunction in SHL, we further used ATOH1/RFX1/RFX3 to differentiate HC-like cells from the iPSCs from patients with myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibres (MERRF) syndrome, which is caused by A8344G mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and characterised by myoclonus epilepsy, ataxia and SHL. Compared with isogenic iPSCs, MERRF-iPSCs possessed {\~{}}42-44{\%} mtDNA with A8344G mutation and exhibited significantly elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and CAT gene expression. Furthermore, MERRF-iPSC-differentiated HC-like cells exhibited significantly elevated ROS levels and MnSOD and CAT gene expression. These MERRF-HCs that had more single cilia with a shorter length could be observed only by using a non-TF method, but those with fewer stereociliary bundle-like protrusions than isogenic iPSCs-differentiated-HC-like cells could be further observed using ATOH1/RFX1/RFX3 TFs. We further analysed and compared the whole transcriptome of M1 ctrl -HCs and M1-HCs after treatment with ATOH1 or ATOH1/RFX1/RFX3. We revealed that the HC-related gene transcripts in M1 ctrl -iPSCs had a significantly higher tendency to be activated by ATOH1/RFX1/RFX3 than M1-iPSCs. The ATOH1/RFX1/RFX3 TF-driven approach for the differentiation of HC-like cells from iPSCs is an efficient and promising strategy for the disease modelling of SHL and can be employed in future therapeutic strategies to treat SHL patients.},

abstract = {The evolution of a solid tumor is fueled by genetic aberrations. Yet, the tumor environment often dominates over the effects of genetics: normal tissues have powerful tumor-suppressive properties that constantly tame or eliminate cells carrying transforming mutations. Critical elements of such a suppressive microenvironment are structural characteristics of normal cells and tissues, such as cell polarity, attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and epithelial organization. Once these tissue-level checkpoints have been overcome, tumor growth is enhanced by recruitment of stromal cells and remodeling of the ECM. Genetic inactivation in mouse models indicates the Hippo pathway as a fundamental inhibitor of organ growth during development and as a critical tumor suppressor in epithelial tissues, such as the liver, skin, and ovaries, and soft tissues. At the centerpiece of this pathway lie two related transcriptional coactivators, YAP and TAZ, that promote tissue proliferation and the self-renewal of normal and cancer stem cells, and incite metastasis. Strikingly, YAP and TAZ are controlled by the same architectural features that first inhibit and then foster cancer growth, such as ECM elasticity, cell shape, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These findings open unexpected opportunities for the development of new cancer therapeutics targeting key YAP/TAZ regulatory inputs such as Wnt signaling, cytoskeletal contractility, G-protein-coupled receptors, or YAP/TAZ-regulated transcription.},

abstract = {Cilia are microtubule-based cellular organelles that mediate signal transduction. Cilia are organized into several structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the basal body, the transition zone (TZ), and the cilia shaft. In vertebrates, the cystoprotein Inversin localizes to a portion of the cilia shaft adjacent to the TZ, a region termed the "Inversin compartment" (InvC). The mechanisms that establish and maintain the InvC are unknown. In the roundworm C. elegans, the cilia shafts of amphid channel and phasmid sensory cilia are subdivided into two regions defined by different microtubule ultrastructure: a proximal doublet-based region adjacent to the TZ, and a distal singlet-based region. It has been suggested that C. elegans cilia also possess an InvC, similarly to mammalian primary cilia. Here we explored the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the C. elegans ciliary doublet region and InvC. We show that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the doublet region. nphp-2 (the C. elegans Inversin homolog) and the doublet region genes arl-13, klp-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for ciliogenesis. InvC and doublet region genes can be sorted into two modules-nphp-2+klp-11 and arl-13+unc-119-which are both antagonized by the hdac-6 deacetylase. The genes of this network modulate the sizes of the NPHP-2 InvC and ARL-13 doublet region. Glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of InvC and doublet region components; rather, glutamylation is modulated by nphp-2, arl-13, and unc-119. The ciliary targeting and restricted localization of NPHP-2, ARL-13, and UNC-119 does not require TZ-, doublet region, and InvC-associated genes. NPHP-2 does require its calcium binding EF hand domain for targeting to the InvC. We conclude that the C. elegans InvC is distinct from the doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization.},

Similarly, many adult cardiac diseases involve transcriptional changes and sometimes have a developmental basis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of transcripts that regulate cellular processes by controlling gene expression; however, detailed insights into their biological and mechanistic functions are only beginning to emerge. Here, we discuss recent findings suggesting that lncRNAs are important factors in regulation of mammalian cardiogenesis and in the pathogenesis of CHD as well as adult cardiac disease. We also outline potential methodological and conceptual considerations for future studies of lncRNAs in the heart and other contexts.},

In recent years, progress has been made towards understanding how the distinct cell biological processes that together drive apical constriction are coordinated. These processes include the contraction of actin-myosin networks, which generates force, and the attachment of actin networks to cell-cell junctions, which allows forces to be transmitted between cells. Different cell types regulate contractility and adhesion in unique ways, resulting in apical constriction with varying dynamics and subcellular organizations, as well as a variety of resulting tissue shape changes. Understanding both the common themes and the variations in apical constriction mechanisms promises to provide insight into the mechanics that underlie tissue morphogenesis.},

abstract = {During embryonic development, cells become organized into complex tissues. Cells need to adhere and communicate with their immediate and remote neighbors to allow morphogenesis to take place in a coordinated way. Cell-cell adhesion, mediated by transmembrane adhesion receptors such as Cadherins and their intracellular interaction partners, is intimately linked to cell contractility that drives cell shape changes. Research in recent years has revealed that the contractile machinery responsible for cell shape changes, actomyosin, can in fact be organized into a number of different functional assemblies such as cortical-junctional actomyosin, apical-medial actomyosin, supracellular actomyosin cables as well as basal actomyosin networks. During coordinated shape changes of a tissue, these assemblies have to be functionally and mechanically linked between cells through cell-cell junctions. Although many actin-binding proteins associated with adherens junctions have been identified, which specific factors are required for the linkage of particular actomyosin assemblies to junctions is not well understood. This review will summarize our current knowledge, based mainly on the in vivo study of morphogenesis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.},

Here, we dissect the role of the chemokine guidance receptor Cxcr4b in regulating the collective migration of one such cohesive tissue, the zebrafish lateral line primordium. Using in vivo imaging, we show that the shape and organization of the primordium is surprisingly labile, and that internal cell movements are uncoordinated in embryos with reduced Cxcr4b signaling. Genetic mosaic experiments reveal that single cxcr4b mutant cells can migrate in a directional manner when placed in wild-type primordia, but that they are specifically excluded from the leading edge. Moreover, a remarkably small number of SDF1a-responsive cells are able to organize an entire cxcr4b mutant primordium to restore migration and organogenesis in the lateral line. These results reveal a role for chemokine signaling in mediating the self-organizing migration of tissues during morphogenesis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In order to prevent the diffusion of damaging degradation products, dying neurons are quickly digested by microglia. Despite the importance of microglia in several neuronal pathologies, the mechanism underlying their degradation of neurons remains elusive. Here, we exploit a microglial population in the zebrafish to study this process in intact living brains. In vivo imaging reveals that digestion of neurons occurs in compartments arising from the progressive fusion of vesicles. We demonstrate that this fusion is mediated by the v0-ATPase a1 subunit. By applying live pH indicators, we show that the a1 subunit mediates fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes during phagocytosis, a function that is independent of its proton pump activity. As a real-time description of microglial phagocytosis in vivo, this work advances our understanding of microglial-mediated neuronal degeneration, a hallmark of many neuronal diseases.},

Although Sd has been implicated as a DNA-binding transcription factor partner for Yki and can genetically account for gain-of-function Yki phenotypes, how Yki regulates normal tissue growth remains a long-standing puzzle because Sd, unlike Yki, is dispensable for normal growth in most Drosophila tissues. Here we show that the yki mutant phenotypes in multiple developmental contexts are rescued by inactivation of Sd, suggesting that Sd functions as a default repressor and that Yki promotes normal tissue growth by relieving Sd-mediated default repression. We further identify Tgi as a cofactor involved in Sd's default repressor function and demonstrate that the mammalian ortholog of Tgi potently suppresses the YAP oncoprotein in transgenic mice. These findings fill a major gap in Hippo-mediated transcriptional regulation and open up possibilities for modulating the YAP oncoprotein in cancer and regenerative medicine. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Whereas mammalian hair cells are not replaced when lost, in fish they constantly renew and regenerate after injury. In vivo tracking and cell fate analyses of all dividing cells during lateral line hair cell regeneration revealed that support and hair cell progenitors localize to distinct tissue compartments. Importantly, we find that the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in these compartments is controlled by spatially restricted Notch signaling and its inhibition of Wnt-induced proliferation. The ability to simultaneously study and manipulate individual cell behaviors and multiple pathways in vivo transforms the lateral line into a powerful paradigm to mechanistically dissect sensory organ regeneration.

abstract = {The embryonic development of the posterior lateral line of zebrafish involves the migration from head to tail of a primordium comprising approximately 100 cells, and the deposition at regular intervals of presumptive mechanosensory organs (neuromasts). Migration depends on the presence of chemokine SDF1 along the pathway, and on the asymmetrical distribution of chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 in the primordium. Primordium polarization depends on Wnt signaling in the leading region. Here, we examine the role of a major effector of Wnt signaling, lef1, in this system. We show that, although its inactivation has no overt effect on the expression of cxcr4b and cxcr7b, lef1 contributes to their control. We also show that cell proliferation, which ensures constant primordium size despite successive rounds of cell deposition, is reduced upon lef1 inactivation. Because of this defect, the primordium runs short of cells and vanishes before the line has been completed. We conclude that lef1-mediated Wnt signaling is involved in various aspects of primordium migration, although part of this implication is masked by a high level of developmental redundancy.},

abstract = {In the nematode C. elegans, RNAi silencing signals are efficiently taken up from the environment and transported between cells and tissues. Previous studies implicating endosomal proteins in systemic RNAi lack conclusive evidence. Here, we report the identification and characterization of SID-5, a C. elegans endosome-associated protein that is required for efficient systemic RNAi in response to both ingested and expressed double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). SID-5 is detected in cytoplasmic foci that partially colocalize with GFP fusions of late endosomal proteins RAB-7 and LMP-1. Furthermore, knockdown of various endosomal proteins similarly relocalizes both SID-5 and LMP-1::GFP. Consistent with a non-cell-autonomous function, intestine-specific SID-5 expression restored body wall muscle (bwm) target gene silencing in response to ingested dsRNA. Finally, we show that sid-5 is required for the previously described sid-1-independent transport of ingested RNAi triggers across the intestine. Together, these data demonstrate that an endosome-associated protein, SID-5, promotes the transport of RNAi silencing signals between cells. Furthermore, SID-5 acts differently than the previously described SID-1, SID-2, and SID-3 proteins, thus expanding the systemic RNAi pathway.},

abstract = {To investigate the role of Hippo pathway signaling during vertebrate development transgenic zebrafish lines were generated and validated to dynamically monitor and manipulate Yap/Taz-Tead activity. Spatial and temporal analysis of Yap/Taz-Tead activity suggested the importance of Hippo signaling during cardiac precursor migration and other developmental processes. When the transcriptional co-activators, Yap and Taz were restricted from interacting with DNA-binding Tead transcription factors through expression of a dominant negative transgene, cardiac precursors failed to migrate completely to the midline resulting in strong cardia bifida. Yap/Taz-Tead activity reporters also allowed us to investigate upstream and downstream factors known to regulate Hippo signaling output in Drosophila. While Crumbs mutations in Drosophila eye disc epithelia increase nuclear translocation and activity of Yorkie (the fly homolog of Yap/Taz), zebrafish crb2a mutants lacked nuclear Yap positive cells and down-regulated Yap/Taz-Tead activity reporters in the eye epithelia, despite the loss of apical-basal cell polarity in those cells. However, as an example of evolutionary conservation, the Tondu-domain containing protein Vestigial-like 4b (Vgll4b) was found to down-regulate endogenous Yap/Taz-Tead activity in the retinal pigment epithelium, similar to Drosophila Tgi in imaginal discs. In conclusion, the Yap/Taz-Tead activity reporters revealed the dynamics of Yap/Taz-Tead signaling and novel insights into Hippo pathway regulation for vertebrates. These studies highlight the utility of this transgenic tool-suite for ongoing analysis into the mechanisms of Hippo pathway regulation and the consequences of signaling output.},

abstract = {Key cellular decisions, such as proliferation or growth arrest, typically occur at spatially defined locations within tissues. Loss of this spatial control is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancer. Yet, how these patterns are established is incompletely understood. Here, we report that physical and architectural features of a multicellular sheet inform cells about their proliferative capacity through mechanical regulation of YAP and TAZ, known mediators of Hippo signaling and organ growth. YAP/TAZ activity is confined to cells exposed to mechanical stresses, such as stretching, location at edges/curvatures contouring an epithelial sheet, or stiffness of the surrounding extracellular matrix. We identify the F-actin-capping/severing proteins Cofilin, CapZ, and Gelsolin as essential gatekeepers that limit YAP/TAZ activity in cells experiencing low mechanical stresses, including contact inhibition of proliferation. We propose that mechanical forces are overarching regulators of YAP/TAZ in multicellular contexts, setting responsiveness to Hippo, WNT, and GPCR signaling. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The primary cilium is an antenna-like, nonmotile structure that extends from the surface of most mammalian cell types and is critical for chemosensing and mechanosensing in a variety of tissues including cartilage, bone, and kidney. Flow-induced intracellular calcium ion (Ca(2+)) increases in kidney epithelia depend on primary cilia and primary cilium-localized Ca(2+)-permeable channels polycystin-2 (PC2) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4). While primary cilia have been implicated in osteocyte mechanotransduction, the molecular mechanism that mediates this process is not fully understood. We directed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Ca(2+) biosensor to the cilium by fusing the biosensor sequence to the sequence of the primary cilium-specific protein Arl13b. Using this tool, we investigated the role of several Ca(2+)-permeable channels that may mediate flow-induced Ca(2+) entry: PC2, TRPV4, and PIEZO1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we report the first measurements of Ca(2+) signaling within osteocyte primary cilia using a FRET-based biosensor fused to ARL13B. We show that fluid flow induces Ca(2+) increases in osteocyte primary cilia which depend on both intracellular Ca(2+) release and extracellular Ca(2+) entry. Using siRNA-mediated knockdowns, we demonstrate that TRPV4, but not PC2 or PIEZO1, mediates flow-induced ciliary Ca(2+) increases and loading-induced Cox-2 mRNA increases, an osteogenic response.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show that the primary cilium forms a Ca(2+) microdomain dependent on Ca(2+) entry through TRPV4. These results demonstrate that the mechanism of mechanotransduction mediated by primary cilia varies in different tissue contexts. Additionally, we anticipate that this work is a starting point for more studies investigating the role of TRPV4 in mechanotransduction.},

However, the mechanisms by which sav and wts regulate growth and apoptosis are not well understood. Here, we describe mutations in hippo (hpo), which encodes a protein kinase most related to mammalian Mst1 and Mst2. Like wts and sav, hpo mutations result in increased tissue growth and impaired apoptosis characterized by elevated levels of the cell cycle regulator cyclin E and apoptosis inhibitor DIAP1. Hpo, Sav, and Wts interact physically and functionally, and regulate DIAP1 levels, likely by Hpo-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. Thus, Hpo links Sav and Wts to a key regulator of apoptosis.},

Both organs have hair cells, which are the mechanoreceptor cells, and supporting cells providing other functions to the epithelium. In most vertebrates (excluding mammals), supporting cells comprise a pool of progenitors that replace damaged or dead hair cells. However, the lack of regenerative capacity in mammals is the single leading cause for acquired hearing disorders in humans.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In an effort to understand the regenerative process of hair cells in fish, we characterized and cloned an egfp transgenic stable fish line that trapped tnks1bp1, a highly conserved gene that has been implicated in the maintenance of telomeres' length.

Therefore we are providing a new set of markers specific for supporting cells as well as candidates for functional analysis of this important cell type.

abstract = {Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are a class of naturally occurring DNA-binding proteins found in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas sp. The DNA-binding domain of each TALE consists of tandem 34-amino acid repeat modules that can be rearranged according to a simple cipher to target new DNA sequences. Customized TALEs can be used for a wide variety of genome engineering applications, including transcriptional modulation and genome editing. Here we describe a toolbox for rapid construction of custom TALE transcription factors (TALE-TFs) and nucleases (TALENs) using a hierarchical ligation procedure. This toolbox facilitates affordable and rapid construction of custom TALE-TFs and TALENs within 1 week and can be easily scaled up to construct TALEs for multiple targets in parallel. We also provide details for testing the activity in mammalian cells of custom TALE-TFs and TALENs using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and Surveyor nuclease, respectively. The TALE toolbox described here will enable a broad range of biological applications.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Apical constriction is a widely utilized cell shape change linked to folding, bending and invagination of polarized epithelia. It remains unclear how apical constriction is regulated spatiotemporally during tissue invagination and how this cellular process contributes to tube formation in different developmental contexts. Using {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Drosophila{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} salivary gland (SG) invagination as a model, we show that regulation of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}folded gastrulation{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} expression by the Fork head transcription factor is required for apicomedial accumulation of Rho kinase and non-muscle myosin II, which coordinate apical constriction. We demonstrate that neither loss of spatially coordinated apical constriction nor its complete blockage prevent internalization and tube formation, although such manipulations affect the geometry of invagination. When apical constriction is disrupted, compressing force generated by a tissue-level myosin cable contributes to SG invagination. We demonstrate that fully elongated polarized SGs can form outside the embryo, suggesting that tube formation and elongation are intrinsic properties of the SG. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Collective cell migration has a key role during morphogenesis and during wound healing and tissue renewal in the adult, and it is involved in cancer spreading. In addition to displaying a coordinated migratory behaviour, collectively migrating cells move more efficiently than if they migrated separately, which indicates that a cellular interplay occurs during collective cell migration. In recent years, evidence has accumulated confirming the importance of such intercellular communication and exploring the molecular mechanisms involved. These mechanisms are based both on direct physical interactions, which coordinate the cellular responses, and on the collective cell behaviour that generates an optimal environment for efficient directed migration. The recent studies have described how leader cells at the front of cell groups drive migration and have highlighted the importance of follower cells and cell-cell communication, both between followers and between follower and leader cells, to improve the efficiency of collective movement.},

abstract = {Small G-proteins of the ADP-ribosylation-factor-like (Arl) subfamily have been shown to be crucial to ciliogenesis and cilia maintenance. Active Arl3 is involved in targeting and releasing lipidated cargo proteins from their carriers PDE6$\delta$ and UNC119a/b to the cilium. However, the Guanine-Nucleotide-Exchange-factor (GEF) which activates Arl3 is unknown. Here we show that the ciliary G-protein Arl13B mutated in Joubert-Syndrome is the GEF for Arl3 and its function is conserved in evolution. The GEF activity of Arl13B is mediated by the G-domain plus an additional C-terminal helix. The switch regions of Arl13B are involved in the interaction with Arl3. Overexpression of Arl13B in mammalian cell lines leads to an increased Arl3•GTP level, whereas Arl13B Joubert-Syndrome patient mutations impair GEF activity and thus Arl3 activation. We anticipate that through Arl13B's exclusive ciliary localization, Arl3 activation is spatially restricted and thereby an Arl3•GTP compartment generated where ciliary cargo is specifically released.},

We show that, compared to manual classification, automatic classification results in 90 to 100{\%} agreement with consensus voting of biological experts in nine out of eleven considered defects in 3 days old zebrafish larvae. Automation of the analysis and classification of zebrafish embryo pictures reduces the workload and time required for the biological expert and increases the reproducibility and objectivity of this classification.},

Points of light in exhaustively deconvolved images of hybridized cells gave fluorescent intensities and distances between probes consistent with single messenger RNA molecules. Analysis of beta-actin transcription sites after serum induction revealed synchronous and cyclical transcription from single genes. The rates of transcription initiation and termination and messenger RNA processing could be determined by positioning probes along the transcription unit.

Key processes regulated by TAZ/YAP include the control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, movement and fate. Accurate control of the levels and localization of these factors is thus essential for early developmental events, as well as for tissue homeostasis, repair and regeneration. Recent studies have revealed that TAZ/YAP activity is regulated by mechanical and cytoskeletal cues as well as by various extracellular factors. Here, I provide an overview of these and other regulatory mechanisms and outline important developmental processes controlled by TAZ and YAP.},

abstract = {Detachment of newborn neurons from the neuroepithelium is required for correct neuronal architecture and functional circuitry. This process, also known as delamination, involves adherens-junction disassembly and acto-myosin-mediated abscission, during which the centrosome is retained while apical/ciliary membranes are shed. Cell-biological mechanisms mediating delamination are, however, poorly understood. Using live-tissue and super-resolution imaging, we uncover a centrosome-nucleated wheel-like microtubule configuration, aligned with the apical actin cable and adherens-junctions within chick and mouse neuroepithelial cells. These microtubules maintain adherens-junctions while actin maintains microtubules, adherens-junctions and apical end-foot dimensions. During neuronal delamination, acto-myosin constriction generates a tunnel-like actin-microtubule configuration through which the centrosome translocates. This movement requires inter-dependent actin and microtubule activity, and we identify drebrin as a potential coordinator of these cytoskeletal dynamics. Furthermore, centrosome compromise revealed that this organelle is required for delamination. These findings identify new cytoskeletal configurations and regulatory relationships that orchestrate neuronal delamination and may inform mechanisms underlying pathological epithelial cell detachment.},

This clock is comprised of a population of coordinated oscillating cells that together produce rhythmic gene expression patterns in the embryo. Whether individual cells autonomously maintain oscillations, or whether oscillations depend on signals from neighboring cells is unknown. Using a transgenic zebrafish reporter line for the cyclic transcription factor Her1, we recorded single tailbud cells in vitro. We demonstrate that individual cells can behave as autonomous cellular oscillators. We described the observed variability in cell behavior using a theory of generic oscillators with correlated noise. Single cells have longer periods and lower precision than the tissue, highlighting the role of collective processes in the segmentation clock. Our work reveals a population of cells from the zebrafish segmentation clock that behave as self-sustained, autonomous oscillators with distinctive noisy dynamics.},

This is because BAC transgenes are usually microinjected as naked DNA into fertilized eggs and are known to integrate as multi-copy concatamers in the genome. Although conventional methods for BAC transgenesis have been very fruitful, complementary methods for generating single copy BAC integrations would be desirable for many applications. RESULTS: We took advantage of the precise cut-and-paste behavior of a natural transposon, Tol2, to develop a new method for BAC transgenesis. In this new method, the minimal sequences of the Tol2 transposon were used to deliver precisely single copies of a approximately 70 kb BAC transgene to the zebrafish and mouse genomes. We mapped the BAC insertion sites in the genome by standard PCR methods and confirmed transposase-mediated integrations. CONCLUSION: The Tol2 transposon has a surprisingly large cargo capacity that can be harnessed for BAC transgenesis. The precise delivery of single-copy BAC transgenes by Tol2 represents a useful complement to conventional BAC transgenesis, and could aid greatly in the production of transgenic fish and mice for genomics projects, especially those in which single-copy integrations are desired.},

abstract = {In situ hybridization based on the mechanism of the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) has addressed multi-decade challenges that impeded imaging of mRNA expression in diverse organisms, offering a unique combination of multiplexing, quantitation, sensitivity, resolution and versatility. Here, with third-generation in situ HCR, we augment these capabilities using probes and amplifiers that combine to provide automatic background suppression throughout the protocol, ensuring that reagents will not generate amplified background even if they bind non-specifically within the sample. Automatic background suppression dramatically enhances performance and robustness, combining the benefits of a higher signal-to-background ratio with the convenience of using unoptimized probe sets for new targets and organisms. In situ HCR v3.0 enables three multiplexed quantitative analysis modes: (1) qHCR imaging - analog mRNA relative quantitation with subcellular resolution in the anatomical context of whole-mount vertebrate embryos; (2) qHCR flow cytometry - analog mRNA relative quantitation for high-throughput expression profiling of mammalian and bacterial cells; and (3) dHCR imaging - digital mRNA absolute quantitation via single-molecule imaging in thick autofluorescent samples.},

Students undertook a range of experiments including direct observation of live wild-type zebrafish at different stages of embryogenesis, whole-mount in situ hybridization of mutant and wild-type embryos, vital dye staining of mutant and wild-type embryos, and pharmacological treatments to perturb normal development. These laboratories engaged the students by providing a hands-on, research-centered experience, while also enhancing their written (worksheets and laboratory reports) and oral (group presentation) communication skills. We describe the proceedings of each lab and the logistics of preparing and running these labs for 400-500 students (120 students taking lab each day), and provide a preliminary assessment of the success of the laboratories data based on student evaluations.},

@article{Chan2015,
abstract = {The cellular cytoskeleton is crucial for many cellular functions such as cell motility and wound healing, as well as other processes that require shape change or force generation. Actin is one cytoskeleton component that regulates cell mechanics. Important properties driving this regulation include the amount of actin, its level of cross-linking, and its coordination with the activity of specific molecular motors like myosin. While studies investigating the contribution of myosin activity to cell mechanics have been performed on cells attached to a substrate, we investigated mechanical properties of cells in suspension. To do this, we used multiple probes for cell mechanics including a microfluidic optical stretcher, a microfluidic microcirculation mimetic, and real-time deformability cytometry. We found that nonadherent blood cells, cells arrested in mitosis, and naturally adherent cells brought into suspension, stiffen and become more solidlike upon myosin inhibition across multiple timescales (milliseconds to minutes). Our results hold across several pharmacological and genetic perturbations targeting myosin. Our findings suggest that myosin II activity contributes to increased whole-cell compliance and fluidity. This finding is contrary to what has been reported for cells attached to a substrate, which stiffen via active myosin driven prestress. Our results establish the importance of myosin II as an active component in modulating suspended cell mechanics, with a functional role distinctly different from that for substrate-adhered cells.},

@article{Essner2005,
abstract = {Monocilia have been proposed to establish the left-right (LR) body axis in vertebrate embryos by creating a directional fluid flow that triggers asymmetric gene expression. In zebrafish, dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) express a conserved ciliary dynein gene (left-right dynein-related1, lrdr1) and form a ciliated epithelium inside a fluid-filled organ called Kupffer's vesicle (KV). Here, videomicroscopy demonstrates that cilia inside KV are motile and create a directional fluid flow just prior to the onset of asymmetric gene expression in lateral cells. Laser ablation of DFCs and surgical disruption of KV provide direct evidence that ciliated KV cells are required during early somitogenesis for subsequent LR patterning in the brain, heart and gut. Antisense morpholinos against lrdr1 disrupt KV fluid flow and perturb LR development. Furthermore, lrdr1 morpholinos targeted to DFC/KV cells demonstrate that Lrdr1 functions in these ciliated cells to control LR patterning. This provides the first direct evidence, in any vertebrate, that impairing cilia function in derivatives of the dorsal organizer, and not in other cells that express ciliogenic genes, alters LR development. Finally, genetic analysis reveals novel roles for the T-box transcription factor no tail and the Nodal signaling pathway as upstream regulators of lrdr1 expression and KV morphogenesis. We propose that KV is a transient embryonic 'organ of asymmetry' that directs LR development by establishing a directional fluid flow. These results suggest that cilia are an essential component of a conserved mechanism that controls the transition from bilateral symmetry to LR asymmetry in vertebrates.},

abstract = {A major challenge in analyzing animal behavior is to discover some underlying simplicity in complex motor actions. Here, we show that the space of shapes adopted by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is low dimensional, with just four dimensions accounting for 95{\%} of the shape variance. These dimensions provide a quantitative description of worm behavior, and we partially reconstruct "equations of motion" for the dynamics in this space. These dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli. Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively "steering" the worm in real time.},

abstract = {The signals that initiate cell invasion are not well understood, but there is increasing evidence that extracellular physical signals play an important role. Here we show that epithelial cell invasion in the intestine of zebrafish meltdown (mlt) mutants arises in response to unregulated contractile tone in the surrounding smooth muscle cell layer. Physical signaling in mlt drives formation of membrane protrusions within the epithelium that resemble invadopodia, matrix-degrading protrusions present in invasive cancer cells. Knockdown of Tks5, a Src substrate that is required for invadopodia formation in mammalian cells blocked formation of the protrusions and rescued invasion in mlt. Activation of Src-signaling induced invadopodia-like protrusions in wild type epithelial cells, however the cells did not migrate into the tissue stroma, thus indicating that the protrusions were required but not sufficient for invasion in this in vivo model. Transcriptional profiling experiments showed that genes responsive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) were upregulated in mlt larvae. ROS generators induced invadopodia-like protrusions and invasion in heterozygous mlt larvae but had no effect in wild type larvae. Co-activation of oncogenic Ras and Wnt signaling enhanced the responsiveness of mlt heterozygotes to the ROS generators. These findings present the first direct evidence that invadopodia play a role in tissue cell invasion in vivo. In addition, they identify an inducible physical signaling pathway sensitive to redox and oncogenic signaling that can drive this process.},

How the Rab GTPase Rab11-Rab8 cascade functions in early ciliary membrane assembly is unknown. Here, we show that the membrane shaping proteins EHD1 and EHD3, in association with the Rab11-Rab8 cascade, function in early ciliogenesis. EHD1 and EHD3 localize to preciliary membranes and the ciliary pocket. EHD-dependent membrane tubulation is essential for ciliary vesicle formation from smaller distal appendage vesicles (DAVs). Importantly, this step functions in M-centriole to basal body transformation and recruitment of transition zone proteins and IFT20. SNAP29, a SNARE membrane fusion regulator and EHD1-binding protein, is also required for DAV-mediated ciliary vesicle assembly. Interestingly, only after ciliary vesicle assembly is Rab8 activated for ciliary growth. Our studies uncover molecular mechanisms informing a previously uncharacterized ciliogenesis step, whereby EHD1 and EHD3 reorganize the M-centriole and associated DAVs before coordinated ciliary membrane and axoneme growth.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Garrigues et al.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify regions of the genome correlated with disease risk but are restricted in their ability to identify the underlying causative mechanism(s). Thus, GWAS are useful "roadmaps" that require functional analysis to establish the genetic and mechanistic structure of a particular locus. Unfortunately, direct functional testing in humans is limited, demonstrating the need for complementary approaches. Here we used an integrated approach combining zebrafish, rat, and human data to interrogate the function of an established GWAS locus (SHROOM3) lacking prior functional support for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Congenic mapping and sequence analysis in rats suggested Shroom3 was a strong positional candidate gene. Transferring a 6.1-Mb region containing the wild-type Shroom3 gene significantly improved the kidney glomerular function in FHH (fawn-hooded hypertensive) rat. The wild-type Shroom3 allele, but not the FHH Shroom3 allele, rescued glomerular defects induced by knockdown of endogenous shroom3 in zebrafish, suggesting that the FHH Shroom3 allele is defective and likely contributes to renal injury in the FHH rat. We also show for the first time that variants disrupting the actin-binding domain of SHROOM3 may cause podocyte effacement and impairment of the glomerular filtration barrier.},

abstract = {Nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) is thought to be the master integrator of force within epithelial apical junctions, mediating epithelial tissue morphogenesis and tensional homeostasis [1-3]. Mutations in NMII are associated with a number of diseases due to failures in cell-cell adhesion [4-8]. However, the organization and the precise mechanism by which NMII generates and responds to tension along the intercellular junctional line are still not known. We discovered that periodic assemblies of bipolar NMII filaments interlace with perijunctional actin and $\alpha$-actinin to form a continuous belt of muscle-like sarcomeric units (∼400-600 nm) around each epithelial cell. Remarkably, the sarcomeres of adjacent cells are precisely paired across the junctional line, forming an integrated, transcellular contractile network. The contraction/relaxation of paired sarcomeres concomitantly impacts changes in apical cell shape and tissue geometry. We show differential distribution of NMII isoforms across heterotypic junctions and evidence for compensation between isoforms. Our results provide a model for how NMII force generation is effected along the junctional perimeter of each cell and communicated across neighboring cells in the epithelial organization. The sarcomeric network also provides a well-defined target to investigate the multiple roles of NMII in junctional homeostasis as well as in development and disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The control of cell number during animal development is a longstanding puzzle. Recent studies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have defined a new signaling pathway that restricts cell proliferation in differentiating epithelia. The cytoskeletal proteins Merlin and Expanded, which play a role in cell adhesion and structure, control the activation of the Hippo/Salvador kinase complex, which in turn activates the Warts/Mats kinase complex. Warts/Mats kinase phosphorylates and inhibits Yorkie, a transcriptional coactivator that positively regulates cell growth, survival, and proliferation. This conserved signaling pathway contains several tumor-suppressor genes and regulates the contact inhibition of proliferation in cultured cells. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} During morphogenesis, contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton within individual cells drives cell shape changes that fold tissues. Coordination of cytoskeletal contractility is mediated by regulating RhoA GTPase activity. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inhibit RhoA activity. Most studies of tissue folding, including apical constriction, have focused on how RhoA is activated by GEFs to promote cell contractility, with little investigation as to how GAPs may be important. Here, we identify a critical role for a RhoA GAP, Cumberland GAP (C-GAP), which coordinates with a RhoA GEF, RhoGEF2, to organize spatiotemporal contractility during {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Drosophila melanogaster{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} apical constriction. C-GAP spatially restricts RhoA pathway activity to a central position in the apical cortex. RhoGEF2 pulses precede myosin, and C-GAP is required for pulsation, suggesting that contractile pulses result from RhoA activity cycling. Finally, C-GAP expression level influences the transition from reversible to irreversible cell shape change, which defines the onset of tissue shape change. Our data demonstrate that RhoA activity cycling and modulating the ratio of RhoGEF2 to C-GAP are required for tissue folding. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Brand1996,
abstract = {Tissues of the dorsal midline of vertebrate embryos, such as notochord and floor plate, have been implicated in inductive interactions that pattern the neural tube and somites. In our screen for embryonic visible mutations in the zebrafish we found 113 mutations in more than 27 genes with altered body shape, often with additional defects in CNS development. We concentrated on a subgroup of mutations in ten genes (the midline-group) that cause defective development of the floor plate. By using floor plate markers, such as the signaling molecule sonic hedgehog, we show that the schmalspur (sur) gene is needed for early floor plate development, similar to one-eyed-pinhead (oep) and the previously described cyclops (cyc) gene. In contrast to oep and cyc, sur embryos show deletions of ventral CNS tissue restricted to the mid- and hindbrain, whereas the forebrain appears largely unaffected. In the underlying mesendodermal tissue of the head, sur is needed only for development of the posterior prechordal plate, whereas oep and cyc are required for both anterior and posterior prechordal plate development. Our analysis of sur mutants suggests that defects within the posterior prechordal plate may cause aberrant development of ventral CNS structures in the mid- and hindbrain. Later development of the floor plate is affected in mutant chameleon, you-too, sonic-you, iguana, detour, schmalhans and monorail embryos; these mutants often show additional defects in tissues that are known to depend on signals from notochord and floor plate. For example, sur, con and yot mutants show reduction of motor neurons; median deletions of brain tissue are seen in sur, con and yot embryos; and cyc, con, yot, igu and dtr mutants often show no or abnormal formation of the optic chiasm. We also find fusions of the ventral neurocranium for all midline mutants tested, which may reveal a hitherto unrecognized function of the midline in influencing differentiation of neural crest cells at their destination. As a working hypothesis, we propose that midline-group genes may act to maintain proper structure and inductive function of zebrafish midline tissues.},

abstract = {The timing of cell proliferation is a key factor contributing to the regulation of normal growth. Daily rhythms of cell cycle progression have been documented in a wide range of organisms [1,2]. However, little is known about how environmental, humoral, and cell-autonomous factors contribute to these rhythms. Here, we demonstrate that light plays a key role in cell cycle regulation in the zebrafish. Exposure of larvae to light-dark (LD) cycles causes a range of different cell types to enter S phase predominantly at the end of the day. When larvae are raised in constant darkness (DD), a low level of arrhythmic S phase is observed. In addition, light-entrained cell cycle rhythms persist for several days after transfer to DD, both observations pointing to the involvement of the circadian clock [3-6]. We show that the number of LD cycles experienced is essential for establishing this rhythm during larval development. Furthermore, we reveal that the same phenomenon exists in a zebrafish cell line. This represents the first example of a vertebrate cell culture system where circadian rhythms of the cell cycle are observed. Thus, we implicate the cell-autonomous circadian clock in the regulation of the vertebrate cell cycle by light.},

abstract = {The directed migration of cell collectives is a driving force of embryogenesis. The predominant view in the field is that cells in embryos navigate along pre-patterned chemoattractant gradients. One hypothetical way to free migrating collectives from the requirement of long-range gradients would be through the self-generation of local gradients that travel with them, a strategy that potentially allows self-determined directionality. However, a lack of tools for the visualization of endogenous guidance cues has prevented the demonstration of such self-generated gradients in vivo. Here we define the in vivo dynamics of one key guidance molecule, the chemokine Cxcl12a, by applying a fluorescent timer approach to measure ligand-triggered receptor turnover in living animals. Using the zebrafish lateral line primordium as a model, we show that migrating cell collectives can self-generate gradients of chemokine activity across their length via polarized receptor-mediated internalization. Finally, by engineering an external source of the atypical receptor Cxcr7 that moves with the primordium, we show that a self-generated gradient mechanism is sufficient to direct robust collective migration. This study thus provides, to our knowledge, the first in vivo proof for self-directed tissue migration through local shaping of an extracellular cue and provides a framework for investigating self-directed migration in many other contexts including cancer invasion.},

abstract = {Motivation: Increasingly, biological processes are being studied through time series of RNA expression data collected for large numbers of genes. Because common processes may unfold at varying rates in different experiments or individuals, methods are needed that will allow corresponding expression states in different time series to be mapped to one another. Results: We present implementations of time warping algorithms applicable to RNA and protein expression data and demonstrate their application to published yeast RNA expression time series. Programs executing two warping algorithms are described, a simple warping algorithm and an interpolative algorithm, along with programs that generate graphics that visually present alignment information. We show time warping to be superior to simple clustering at mapping corresponding time states. We document the impact of statistical measurement noise and sample size on the quality of time alignments, and present issues related to statistical assessment of alignment quality through alignment scores. We also discuss directions for algorithm improvement including development of multiple time series alignments and possible applications to causality searches and non-temporal processes ( concentration warping'). Availability: Academic implementations of alignment programs genewarp and genewarpi and the graphics generation programs grphwarp and grphwarpi are available as Win32 system DOS box executables on our web site along with documentation on their use.

abstract = {Appropriate cell number and organ size in a multicellular organism are determined by coordinated cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Disruption of these processes can cause cancer. Recent studies have identified the Large tumor suppressor (Lats)/Warts (Wts) protein kinase as a key component of a pathway that controls the coordination between cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here we describe growth inhibitory functions for a Mob superfamily protein, termed Mats (Mob as tumor suppressor), in Drosophila. Loss of Mats function results in increased cell proliferation, defective apoptosis, and induction of tissue overgrowth. We show that mats and wts function in a common pathway. Mats physically associates with Wts to stimulate the catalytic activity of the Wts kinase. A human Mats ortholog (Mats1) can rescue the lethality associated with loss of Mats function in Drosophila. As Mats1 is mutated in human tumors, Mats-mediated growth inhibition and tumor suppression is likely conserved in humans.},

abstract = {Live-imaging embryos in a high-throughput manner is essential for shedding light on a wide range of questions in developmental biology, but it is difficult and costly to mount and image embryos in consistent conditions. Here, we present OMMAwell, a simple, reusable device that makes it easy to mount up to hundreds of embryos in arrays of agarose microwells with customizable dimensions and spacing. OMMAwell can be configured to mount specimens for upright or inverted microscopes, and includes a reservoir to hold live-imaging medium to maintain constant moisture and osmolarity of specimens during time-lapse imaging. All device components can be cut from a sheet of acrylic using a laser cutter. Even a novice user will be able to cut the pieces and assemble the device in less than an hour. At the time of writing, the total materials cost is less than five US dollars. We include all device design files in a commonly used format, as well as complete instructions for its fabrication and use. We demonstrate a detailed workflow for designing a custom mold and employing it to simultaneously live-image dozens of embryos at a time for more than five days, using embryos of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus as an example. Further, we include descriptions, schematics, and design files for molds that can be used with 14 additional vertebrate and invertebrate species, including most major traditional laboratory models and a number of emerging model systems. Molds have been user-tested for embryos including zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui), annelid worm (Capitella teleta), amphipod crustacean (Parhyale hawaiensis), red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), and three-banded panther worm (Hofstenia miamia), as well mouse organoids (Mus musculus). Finally, we provide instructions for researchers to customize OMMAwell inserts for embryos or tissues not described herein.},

abstract = {Detection of water motion by the lateral line relies on mechanotransduction complexes at stereocilia tips. This sensory system is comprised of neuromasts, patches of hair cells with stereociliary bundles arranged with morphological mirror symmetry that are mechanically responsive to two opposing directions. Here, we find that transmembrane channel-like 2b (Tmc2b) is differentially required for mechanotransduction in the zebrafish lateral line. Despite similarities in neuromast hair cell morphology, three classes of these cells can be distinguished by their Tmc2b reliance. We map mechanosensitivity along the lateral line using imaging and electrophysiology to determine that a hair cell's Tmc2b dependence is governed by neuromast topological position and hair bundle orientation. Overall, water flow is detected by molecular machinery that can vary between hair cells of different neuromasts. Moreover, hair cells within the same neuromast can break morphologic symmetry of the sensory organ at the stereocilia tips.},

abstract = {Recent studies indicate that the DNA recognition domain of transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors can be combined with the nuclease domain of FokI restriction enzyme to produce TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) that, in pairs, bind adjacent DNA target sites and produce double-strand breaks between the target sequences, stimulating non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Here, we exploit the four prevalent TAL repeats and their DNA recognition cipher to develop a 'modular assembly' method for rapid production of designer TALENs (dTALENs) that recognize unique DNA sequence up to 23 bases in any gene. We have used this approach to engineer 10 dTALENs to target specific loci in native yeast chromosomal genes. All dTALENs produced high rates of site-specific gene disruptions and created strains with expected mutant phenotypes. Moreover, dTALENs stimulated high rates (up to 34{\%}) of gene replacement by homologous recombination. Finally, dTALENs caused no detectable cytotoxicity and minimal levels of undesired genetic mutations in the treated yeast strains. These studies expand the realm of verified TALEN activity from cultured human cells to an intact eukaryotic organism and suggest that low-cost, highly dependable dTALENs can assume a significant role for gene modifications of value in human and animal health, agriculture and industry.},

abstract = {Mammalian Wnt proteins are believed to act as short-range signals, yet have not been previously visualized in vivo. Self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation are coordinated along a putative Wnt gradient in the intestinal crypt. Wnt3 is produced specifically by Paneth cells. Here we have generated an epitope-tagged, functional Wnt3 knock-in allele. Wnt3 covers basolateral membranes of neighbouring stem cells. In intestinal organoids, Wnt3-transfer involves direct contact between Paneth cells and stem cells. Plasma membrane localization requires surface expression of Frizzled receptors, which in turn is regulated by the transmembrane E3 ligases Rnf43/Znrf3 and their antagonists Lgr4-5/R-spondin. By manipulating Wnt3 secretion and by arresting stem-cell proliferation, we demonstrate that Wnt3 mainly travels away from its source in a cell-bound manner through cell division, and not through diffusion. We conclude that stem-cell membranes constitute a reservoir for Wnt proteins, while Frizzled receptor turnover and 'plasma membrane dilution' through cell division shape the epithelial Wnt3 gradient.},

On the other hand, its vertices correspond to tricellular contacts, where the corners of three cells meet. Vertebrate tricellular contacts have specialized structures of tight junctions, termed tricellular tight junctions (tTJs). tTJs were identified by electron microscopic observations more than 40 years ago, but have been largely forgotten in epithelial cell biology since then. The identification of tricellulin and angulin family proteins as tTJ-associated membrane proteins has enabled us to study tTJs in terms of not only the paracellular barrier function but also unknown characteristics of epithelial cell corners via molecular biological approaches.},

abstract = {The forebrain is patterned along the dorsoventral (DV) axis by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). However, previous studies have suggested the presence of an Shh-independent mechanism. Our study identifies Wnt/$\beta$-catenin-activated from the telencephalic roof-as an Shh-independent pathway that is essential for telencephalic pallial (dorsal) specification during neurulation. We demonstrate that the transcription factor Foxg1 coordinates the activity of two signaling centers: Foxg1 is a key downstream effector of the Shh pathway during induction of subpallial (ventral) identity, and it inhibits Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling through direct transcriptional repression of Wnt ligands. This inhibition restricts the dorsal Wnt signaling center to the roof plate and consequently limits pallial identities. Concomitantly to these roles, Foxg1 controls the formation of the compartment boundary between telencephalon and basal diencephalon. Altogether, these findings identify a key direct target of Foxg1, and uncover a simple molecular mechanism by which Foxg1 integrates two opposing signaling centers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) act as multifunctional regulators in morphogenesis during development. In particular they play a determinant role in the formation of cartilage molds and their replacement by bone during endochondral ossification. In cell culture, BMP-2 favors chondrogenic expression and promotes hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. In mouse chondrocytes we have identified a BMP-2-sensitive gene encoding a protein of 301 amino acids. This protein, named mIFT46, is the mouse ortholog of recently identified Caenorhabditis elegans and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins. After generation of a polyclonal antibody against mIFT46, we showed for the first time that the endogenous protein is located in the primary cilium of chondrocytes. We also found that mIFT46 is preferentially expressed in early hypertrophic chondrocytes located in the growth plate. Additionally, mIFT46 knockdown by small interfering RNA oligonucleotides in cultured chondrocytes specifically stimulated the expression of several genes related to skeletogenesis. Furthermore, Northern blotting analysis indicated that mIFT46 is also expressed before chondrogenesis in embryonic mouse development, suggesting that the role of mIFT46 might not be restricted to cartilage. To explore the role of IFT46 during early development, we injected antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in Danio rerio embryos to reduce zebrafish IFT46 protein (zIFT46) synthesis. Dramatic defects in embryonic development such as a dorsalization and a tail duplication were observed. Thus our results taken together indicate that the ciliary protein IFT46 has a specific function in chondrocytes and is also essential for normal development of vertebrates.},

abstract = {The lateral line system of teleosts has recently become a model system to study patterning and morphogenesis. However, its embryonic origins are still not well understood. In zebrafish, the posterior lateral line (PLL) system is formed in two waves, one that generates the embryonic line of seven to eight neuromasts and 20 afferent neurons and a second one that generates three additional lines during larval development. The embryonic line originates from a postotic placode that produces both a migrating sensory primordium and afferent neurons. Nothing is known about the origin and innervation of the larval lines. Here we show that a " secondary " placode can be detected at 24 h postfertilization (hpf), shortly after the primary placode has given rise to the embryonic primordium and ganglion. The secondary placode generates two additional sensory primordia, primD and primII, as well as afferent neurons. The primary and secondary placodes require retinoic acid signaling at the same stage of late gastrulation, suggesting that they share a common origin. Neither primary nor secondary neurons show intrinsic specificity for neuromasts derived from their own placode, but the sequence of neuromast deposition ensures that neuromasts are primarily innervated by neurons derived from the cognate placode. The delayed formation of secondary afferent neurons accounts for the capability of the fish to form a new PLL ganglion after ablation of the embryonic ganglion at 24 hpf.},

abstract = {Viruses and transposons are efficient tools for permanently delivering foreign DNA into vertebrate genomes but exhibit diminished activity when cargo exceeds 8 kilobases (kb). This size restriction limits their molecular genetic and biotechnological utility, such as numerous therapeutically relevant genes that exceed 8 kb in size. Furthermore, a greater payload capacity vector would accommodate more sophisticated cis cargo designs to modulate the expression and mutagenic risk of these molecular therapeutics. We show that the Tol2 transposon can efficiently integrate DNA sequences larger than 10 kb into human cells. We characterize minimal sequences necessary for transposition (miniTol2) in vivo in zebrafish and in vitro in human cells. Both the 8.5-kb Tol2 transposon and 5.8-kb miniTol2 engineered elements readily function to revert the deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase in an animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. Together, Tol2 provides a novel nonviral vector for the delivery of large genetic payloads for gene therapy and other transgenic applications.},

Lineage conversion can proceed in a direct manner, in the absence of proliferation and multipotent progenitor generation, or in an indirect manner, by the generation of expandable multipotent progenitor states. Here we report on the development of a combined reprogramming methodology that, transitioning through a plastic intermediate state, allows for the generation of human mesodermal progenitor cells while circumventing the traditional hallmarks of pluripotency. Converted mesodermal progenitor cells demonstrated bi-potent differentiation potential and were able to generate endothelial and smooth muscle lineages. Importantly, human fibroblasts can be converted into angioblast-like progenitor cells by non-integrative approaches. Differentiated angioblast-like cells exhibit neo-angiogenesis and anastomosis . The methodology for indirect lineage conversion to angioblast-like cells described here adds to the in vivo armamentarium of reprogramming approaches aimed at the clinical treatment of ischemic pathologies.

abstract = {Remodeling of epithelial sheets plays important roles in animal morphogenesis. Shroom3 is known to regulate the apical constriction of epithelial cells. Here, we show that Shroom3 binds ROCKs and recruits them to the epithelial apical junctions. We identified the Shroom3-binding site (RII-C1) on ROCKs, and found that RII-C1 could antagonize the Shroom3-ROCK interaction, interfering with the action of Shroom3 on cell morphology. In the invaginating neural plate/tube, Shroom3 colocalized with ROCKs at the apical junctions; Shroom3 depletion or RII-C1 expression in the tube removed these apically localized ROCKs, and concomitantly blocked neural tube closure. Closing neural plate exhibited peculiar cell assemblies, including rosette formation, as well as a planar-polarized distribution of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain, but these were abolished by ROCK inhibition or RII-C1 expression. These results demonstrate that the Shroom3-ROCK interaction is crucial for the regulation of epithelial and neuroepithelial cell arrangement and remodeling.},

In this study, we reported a method for improving the efficiency of germline transmission screening for generation of genome-edited zebrafish mutants. Co-microinjecting yfp-nanos3 mRNA with Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA and single strand DNA donor to label the distribution of microinjected nucleotides in PGCs (primordial germ cells), we demonstrated that founders carrying labeled PGCs produced much higher numbers of knockin and knockout progeny. In comparison with the common practice of selecting founders by genotyping fin clips, our new strategy of selecting founders with tentatively fluorescent-labeled PGCs significantly increase the ease and speed of generating heritable knocking and knockout animals with CRISPR/Cas9.},

@article{Ernst2012a,
abstract = {During development, morphogenetic processes require a precise coordination of cell differentiation, cell shape changes and, often, cell migration. Yet, how pattern information is used to orchestrate these different processes is still unclear. During lateral line (LL) morphogenesis, a group of cells simultaneously migrate and assemble radially organized cell clusters, termed rosettes, that prefigure LL sensory organs. This process is controlled by Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling, which induces cell fate changes, cell migration and cell shape changes. However, the exact molecular mechanisms induced by FGF activation that mediate these changes on a cellular level are not known. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which FGFs control apical constriction and rosette assembly. We show that apical constriction in the LL primordium requires the activity of non-muscle myosin. We demonstrate further that shroom3, a well-known regulator of non-muscle myosin activity, is expressed in the LL primordium and that its expression requires FGF signalling. Using gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that Shroom3 is the main organizer of cell shape changes during rosette assembly, probably by coordinating Rho kinase recruitment and non-muscle myosin activation. In order to quantify morphogenesis in the LL primordium in an unbiased manner, we developed a unique trainable 'rosette detector'. We thus propose a model in which Shroom3 drives rosette assembly in the LL downstream of FGF in a Rho kinase- and non-muscle myosin-dependent manner. In conclusion, we uncovered the first mechanistic link between patterning and morphogenesis during LL sensory organ formation.},

Co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments indicate that hShrm1 and MCAM interact in vivo and by immunofluorescence microscopy some co-localization of these proteins is observed. hShrm1 partly co-localises with beta-actin and is found in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of melanoma cell extracts.

abstract = {FOXG1 is a transcription factor that interacts with multiple signaling pathways and modulates neuronal differentiation in the telencephalon. Dysregulation of FOXG1 expression has been previously reported in medulloblastoma. In this study, we demonstrate a regional specific expression of FOXG1 and its colocalization with Nestin expression in the premigratory mitotically active (outer) layer of the external granular layer of the cerebellum. An inverse expression of the granular precursor cell markers, Math1 and Musashi1, in the inner nonmitotic migratory layer of the external granular layer and in the internal granular layer was observed. Furthermore, modulation of FOXG1 in the medulloblastoma cell line, DAOY, was associated with the induction of neuronal differentiation markers and significant changes in multiple signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. Additionally, we observed enhanced survival in intracerebellar mice xenografts injected with DAOY cells bearing shFOXG1 constructs versus shLuciferase construct. Overall, these findings suggest that down-modulation of FOXG1 is a prerequisite for the onset of neuronal differentiation during cerebellar development and that a decrease of FOXG1 in medulloblastoma cells offers a survival advantage in mice. We propose that the disruption of signaling pathways that promote mature neuronal differentiation by overexpressed FOXG1 is a contributing event in the neoplastic transformation of cerebellar stem cells.},

abstract = {The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been implemented in a variety of model organisms to mediate site-directed mutagenesis. A wide range of mutation rates has been reported, but at a limited number of genomic target sites. To uncover the rules that govern effective Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in zebrafish, we targeted over a hundred genomic loci for mutagenesis using a streamlined and cloning-free method. We generated mutations in 85{\%} of target genes with mutation rates varying across several orders of magnitude, and identified sequence composition rules that influence mutagenesis. We increased rates of mutagenesis by implementing several novel approaches. The activities of poor or unsuccessful single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) initiating with a 5' adenine were improved by rescuing 5' end homogeneity of the sgRNA. In some cases, direct injection of Cas9 protein/sgRNA complex further increased mutagenic activity. We also observed that low diversity of mutant alleles led to repeated failure to obtain frame-shift mutations. This limitation was overcome by knock-in of a stop codon cassette that ensured coding frame truncation. Our improved methods and detailed protocols make Cas9-mediated mutagenesis an attractive approach for labs of all sizes.},

abstract = {The development and maintenance of an epithelium requires finely balanced rates of growth and cell death. However, the mechanical and biochemical mechanisms that ensure proper feedback control of tissue growth, which when deregulated contribute to tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here we use the fly notum as a model system to identify a novel process of crowding-induced cell delamination that balances growth to ensure the development of well-ordered cell packing. In crowded regions of the tissue, a proportion of cells undergo a serial loss of cell-cell junctions and a progressive loss of apical area, before being squeezed out by their neighbours. This path of delamination is recapitulated by a simple computational model of epithelial mechanics, in which stochastic cell loss relieves overcrowding as the system tends towards equilibrium. We show that this process of delamination is mechanistically distinct from apoptosis-mediated cell extrusion and precedes the first signs of cell death. Overall, this analysis reveals a simple mechanism that buffers epithelia against variations in growth. Because live-cell delamination constitutes a mechanistic link between epithelial hyperplasia and cell invasion, this is likely to have important implications for our understanding of the early stages of cancer development.},

The cilium therefore represents a nexus for signalling pathways during development.

abstract = {Epithelial folding mediated by apical constriction converts flat epithelial sheets into multilayered, complex tissue structures and is used throughout development in most animals. Little is known, however, about how forces produced near the apical surface of the tissue are transmitted within individual cells to generate the global changes in cell shape that characterize tissue deformation. Here we apply particle tracking velocimetry in gastrulating Drosophila embryos to measure the movement of cytoplasm and plasma membrane during ventral furrow formation. We find that cytoplasmic redistribution during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation can be precisely described by viscous flows that quantitatively match the predictions of hydrodynamics. Cell membranes move with the ambient cytoplasm, with little resistance to, or driving force on, the flow. Strikingly, apical constriction produces similar flow patterns in mutant embryos that fail to form cells before gastrulation (/`acellular/' embryos), such that the global redistribution of cytoplasm mirrors the summed redistribution occurring in individual cells of wild-type embryos. Our results indicate that during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation, hydrodynamic behaviour of the cytoplasm provides the predominant mechanism transmitting apically generated forces deep into the tissue and that cell individualization is dispensable.},

abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSC) are purported to initiate and maintain tumor growth. Deregulation of normal stem cell signaling may lead to the generation of CSCs; however, the molecular determinants of this process remain poorly understood. Here we show that the transcriptional coactivator YAP1 is a major determinant of CSC properties in nontransformed cells and in esophageal cancer cells by direct upregulation of SOX9. YAP1 regulates the transcription of SOX9 through a conserved TEAD binding site in the SOX9 promoter. Expression of exogenous YAP1 in vitro or inhibition of its upstream negative regulators in vivo results in elevated SOX9 expression accompanied by the acquisition of CSC properties. Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of YAP1 or SOX9 in transformed cells attenuates CSC phenotypes in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. The small-molecule inhibitor of YAP1, verteporfin, significantly blocks CSC properties in cells with high YAP1 and a high proportion of ALDH1(+). Our findings identify YAP1-driven SOX9 expression as a critical event in the acquisition of CSC properties, suggesting that YAP1 inhibition may offer an effective means of therapeutically targeting the CSC population.

Using multiple embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation strategies, we show that Bvht is required for progression of nascent mesoderm toward a cardiac fate. We find that Bvht is necessary for activation of a core cardiovascular gene network and functions upstream of mesoderm posterior 1 (MesP1), a master regulator of a common multipotent cardiovascular progenitor. We also show that Bvht interacts with SUZ12, a component of polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), during cardiomyocyte differentiation, suggesting that Bvht mediates epigenetic regulation of cardiac commitment. Finally, we demonstrate a role for Bvht in maintaining cardiac fate in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Together, our work provides evidence for a long noncoding RNA with critical roles in the establishment of the cardiovascular lineage during mammalian development.},

Here, we revisit the concept that CIL plays a central role in the migration of single cells and in collective migration, during both health and disease. Importantly, malignant cells exhibit a diminished CIL behaviour which allows them to invade healthy tissues. Accumulating evidence indicates that CIL occurs in vivo and that regulation of small Rho GTPases is important in the collapse of cell protrusions upon cell contact, the first step of CIL. Finally, we propose possible cell surface proteins that could be involved in the initial contact that regulates Rho GTPases during CIL. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

During Drosophila gastrulation, mesoderm cells exhibit repeated contractile pulses that are stabilized such that cells apically constrict like a ratchet. The transcription factor Twist is required to stabilize cell shape. However, it is unknown how Twist spatially coordinates downstream signals to prevent cell relaxation. We find that during constriction, Rho-associated kinase (Rok) is polarized to the middle of the apical domain (medioapical cortex), separate from adherens junctions. Rok recruits or stabilizes medioapical myosin II (Myo-II), which contracts dynamic medioapical actin cables. The formin Diaphanous mediates apical actin assembly to suppress medioapical E-cadherin localization and form stable connections between the medioapical contractile network and adherens junctions. Twist is not required for apical Rok recruitment, but instead polarizes Rok medioapically. Therefore, Twist establishes radial cell polarity of Rok/Myo-II and E-cadherin and promotes medioapical actin assembly in mesoderm cells to stabilize cell shape fluctuations.},

An amenable model is provided by the posterior lateral line in zebrafish, which is formed by a cohesive primordium that migrates from head to tail and deposits future neuromasts at intervals. We found that prior to the onset of migration, the compact state of the primordium is not fully established, as isolated cells with lateral line identity are present caudal to the main primordium. These isolated cells are retained in position such that they fuse with the migrating primordium as it advances, and later contribute to the leading zone and terminal neuromasts. We found that the isolated lateral line cells are positioned by two antagonistic cues: Fgf signalling attracts them towards the primordium, which counteracts Sdf1$\alpha$/Cxcr4b-mediated caudal attraction. These findings reveal a novel chemotactic role for Fgf signalling in which it enables the coalescence of the lateral line primordium from an initial fuzzy pattern into a compact group of migrating cells.},

The visualization of proteins residing on intracellular structures by fluorescence microscopy has become a routine approach in cell biology and is increasingly used to assess their colocalization with well-characterized markers. However, image-analysis methods for colocalization studies are a field of contention and enigma. We have therefore undertaken to review the most currently used colocalization analysis methods, introducing the basic optical concepts important for image acquisition and subsequent analysis. We provide a summary of practical tips for image acquisition and treatment that should precede proper colocalization analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the application and feasibility of colocalization tools for various biological colocalization situations and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses.

abstract = {Oncologists often diagnose cancer based on a change of tissue stiffness sensed by palpation, yet cancer researchers generally focus on biochemical signaling mechanisms. Tumors are more rigid because they have a stiffer extracellular matrix. A new study shows that this alteration of matrix mechanics activates integrins, which not only promotes mitogenic signaling through Erk but also cell contractility through Rho, which can further increase matrix stiffness. This establishes a positive feedback loop that switches on the malignant phenotype in mammary epithelial cells. This mechanical "autocrine loop" brings solid-state mechanotransduction on a par with oncogenic signaling pathways in malignant transformation.},

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

abstract = {The lateral line system of anamniote vertebrates enables the detection of local water movement and weak bioelectric fields. Ancestrally, it comprises neuromasts - small sense organs containing mechanosensory hair cells - distributed in characteristic lines over the head and trunk, flanked on the head by fields of electroreceptive ampullary organs, innervated by afferent neurons projecting respectively to the medial and dorsal octavolateral nuclei in the hindbrain. Given the independent loss of the electrosensory system in multiple lineages, the development and evolution of the mechanosensory and electrosensory components of the lateral line must be dissociable. Nevertheless, the entire system arises from a series of cranial lateral line placodes, which exhibit two modes of sensory organ formation: elongation to form sensory ridges that fragment (with neuromasts differentiating in the center of the ridge, and ampullary organs on the flanks), or migration as collectives of cells, depositing sense organs in their wake. Intensive study of the migrating posterior lateral line placode in zebrafish has yielded a wealth of information concerning the molecular control of migration and neuromast formation in this migrating placode, in this cypriniform teleost species. However, our mechanistic understanding of neuromast and ampullary organ formation by elongating lateral line placodes, and even of other zebrafish lateral line placodes, is sparse or non-existent. Here, we attempt to highlight the diversity of lateral line development and the limits of the current research focus on the zebrafish posterior lateral line placode. We hope this will stimulate a broader approach to this fascinating sensory system. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts that structurally resemble mRNAs but do not encode proteins. Recent genome-wide studies in humans and the mouse have annotated lncRNAs expressed in cell lines and adult tissues, but a systematic analysis of lncRNAs expressed during vertebrate embryogenesis has been elusive. To identify lncRNAs with potential functions in vertebrate embryogenesis, we performed a time-series of RNA-seq experiments at eight stages during early zebrafish development. We reconstructed 56,535 high-confidence transcripts in 28,912 loci, recovering the vast majority of expressed RefSeq transcripts while identifying thousands of novel isoforms and expressed loci. We defined a stringent set of 1133 noncoding multi-exonic transcripts expressed during embryogenesis. These include long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs), intronic overlapping lncRNAs, exonic antisense overlapping lncRNAs, and precursors for small RNAs (sRNAs). Zebrafish lncRNAs share many of the characteristics of their mammalian counterparts: relatively short length, low exon number, low expression, and conservation levels comparable to that of introns. Subsets of lncRNAs carry chromatin signatures characteristic of genes with developmental functions. The temporal expression profile of lncRNAs revealed two novel properties: lncRNAs are expressed in narrower time windows than are protein-coding genes and are specifically enriched in early-stage embryos. In addition, several lncRNAs show tissue-specific expression and distinct subcellular localization patterns. Integrative computational analyses associated individual lncRNAs with specific pathways and functions, ranging from cell cycle regulation to morphogenesis. Our study provides the first systematic identification of lncRNAs in a vertebrate embryo and forms the foundation for future genetic, genomic, and evolutionary studies.},

Damage to cellular macromolecules upon excitation light illumination can impair sample physiology, and even lead to sample death. In this review, we explain how phototoxicity influences live samples, and we highlight that, besides the obvious effects of phototoxicity, there are often subtler consequences of illumination that are imperceptible when only the morphology of samples is examined. Such less apparent manifestations of phototoxicity are equally problematic, and can change the conclusions drawn from an experiment. Thus, limiting phototoxicity is a prerequisite for obtaining reproducible quantitative data on biological processes. We present strategies to reduce phototoxicity, e.g. limiting the illumination to the focal plane and suggest controls for phototoxicity effects. Overall, we argue that phototoxicity needs increased attention from researchers when designing experiments, and when evaluating research findings.},

abstract = {The vertebrate craniofacial skeleton develops via a complex process involving signaling cascades in all three germ layers. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is essential for several steps in pharyngeal arch development. In zebrafish, Fgf3 and Fgf8 in the mesoderm and hindbrain have an early role to pattern the pouch endoderm, influencing craniofacial integrity. Endodermal FGF signaling is required for the differentiation and survival of postmigratory neural crest cells that form the pharyngeal skeleton. We identify a novel role for zebrafish Fgf receptor-like 1a (Fgfrl1a) that is indispensable during gill cartilage development. We show that depletion of Fgfrl1a is sufficient to abolish cartilage derivatives of the ceratobranchials. Using an Fgfrl1a-deficient model, we analyzed expression of genes critical for chondrogenesis in the different compartments of the developing pharyngeal arch. Fgfrl1a-depleted animals demonstrate typical neural crest specification and migration to populate the arch primordia as well as normal pouch segmentation. However, in the absence of Fgfrl1a, larvae fail to express the transcription factor glial cells missing 2 (gcm2), a gene necessary for cartilage and gill filament formation, in the ectodermal lining of the branchial arches. In addition, two transcription factors essential for chondrogenesis, sox9a and runx2b, fail to express within the mesenchymal condensations of the branchial arches. A duplicate zebrafish gene, fgfrl1b, has now been identified. We show that Fgfrl1b is also required for proper formation of all ventral cartilage elements and acts cooperatively with Fgfrl1a during gill cartilage formation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Actomyosin contraction generates mechanical forces that influence cell and tissue structure. During convergent extension in Drosophila melanogaster, the spatially regulated activity of the myosin activator Rho-kinase promotes actomyosin contraction at specific planar cell boundaries to produce polarized cell rearrangement. The mechanisms that direct localized Rho-kinase activity are not well understood. We show that Rho GTPase recruits Rho-kinase to adherens junctions and is required for Rho-kinase planar polarity. Shroom, an asymmetrically localized actin- and Rho-kinase-binding protein, amplifies Rho-kinase and myosin II planar polarity and junctional localization downstream of Rho signaling. In Shroom mutants, Rho-kinase and myosin II achieve reduced levels of planar polarity, resulting in decreased junctional tension, a disruption of multicellular rosette formation, and defective convergent extension. These results indicate that Rho GTPase activity is required to establish a planar polarized actomyosin network, and the Shroom actin-binding protein enhances myosin contractility locally to generate robust mechanical forces during axis elongation.},

abstract = {During animal development, organ size is determined primarily by the amount of cell proliferation, which must be tightly regulated to ensure the generation of properly proportioned organs. However, little is known about the molecular pathways that direct cells to stop proliferating when an organ has attained its proper size. We have identified mutations in a novel gene, shar-pei, that is required for proper termination of cell proliferation during Drosophila imaginal disc development. Clones of shar-pei mutant cells in imaginal discs produce enlarged tissues containing more cells of normal size. We show that this phenotype is the result of both increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Hence, shar-pei restricts cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis. By contrast, shar-pei is not required for cell differentiation and pattern formation of adult tissue. Shar-pei is also not required for cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation, indicating that the mechanisms directing cell proliferation arrest during organ growth are distinct from those directing cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation. shar-pei encodes a WW-domain-containing protein that has homologs in worms, mice and humans, suggesting that mechanisms of organ growth control are evolutionarily conserved.},

abstract = {Cell shape changes are critical for morphogenetic events such as gastrulation, neurulation, and organogenesis. However, the cell biology driving cell shape changes is poorly understood, especially in vertebrates. The beginning of Xenopus laevis gastrulation is marked by the apical constriction of bottle cells in the dorsal marginal zone, which bends the tissue and creates a crevice at the blastopore lip. We found that bottle cells contribute significantly to gastrulation, as their shape change can generate the force required for initial blastopore formation. As actin and myosin are often implicated in contraction, we examined their localization and function in bottle cells. F-actin and activated myosin accumulate apically in bottle cells, and actin and myosin inhibitors either prevent or severely perturb bottle cell formation, showing that actomyosin contractility is required for apical constriction. Microtubules were localized in apicobasally directed arrays in bottle cells, emanating from the apical surface. Surprisingly, apical constriction was inhibited in the presence of nocodazole but not taxol, suggesting that intact, but not dynamic, microtubules are required for apical constriction. Our results indicate that actomyosin contractility is required for bottle cell morphogenesis and further suggest a novel and unpredicted role for microtubules during apical constriction.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) represent an assorted class of transcripts having little or no protein coding capacity and have recently gained importance for their function as regulators of gene expression. Molecular studies on lncRNA have uncovered multifaceted interactions with protein coding genes. It has been suggested that lncRNAs are an additional layer of regulatory switches involved in gene regulation during development and disease. LncRNAs expressing in specific tissues or cell types during adult stages can have potential roles in form, function, maintenance and repair of tissues and organs. We used RNA sequencing followed by computational analysis to identify tissue restricted lncRNA transcript signatures from five different tissues of adult zebrafish. The present study reports 442 predicted lncRNA transcripts from adult zebrafish tissues out of which 419 were novel lncRNA transcripts. Of these, 77 lncRNAs show predominant tissue restricted expression across the five major tissues investigated. Adult zebrafish brain expressed the largest number of tissue restricted lncRNA transcripts followed by cardiovascular tissue. We also validated the tissue restricted expression of a subset of lncRNAs using independent methods. Our data constitute a useful genomic resource towards understanding the expression of lncRNAs in various tissues in adult zebrafish. Our study is thus a starting point and opens a way towards discovering new molecular interactions of gene expression within the specific adult tissues in the context of maintenance of organ form and function.},

abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy of the dynamics of living cells presents a special challenge to a microscope imaging system, simultaneously requiring both high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution, but with illumination levels low enough to prevent fluorophore damage and cytotoxicity. We have compared the high-speed Yokogawa CSU10 spinning disc confocal system with several conventional single-point scanning confocal (SPSC) microscopes, using the relationship between image signal-to-noise ratio and fluorophore photobleaching as an index of system efficiency. These studies demonstrate that the efficiency of the CSU10 consistently exceeds that of the SPSC systems. The high efficiency of the CSU10 means that quality images can be collected with much lower levels of illumination; the CSU10 was capable of achieving the maximum signal-to-noise of an SPSC system at illumination levels that incur only at 1/15th of the rate of the photobleaching of the SPSC system. Although some of the relative efficiency of the CSU10 system may be attributed to the use of a CCD rather than a photomultiplier detector system, our analyses indicate that high-speed imaging with the SPSC system is limited by fluorescence saturation at the high levels of illumination frequently needed to collect images at high frame rates. The high speed, high efficiency and freedom from fluorescence saturation combine to make the CSU10 effective for extended imaging of living cells at rates capable of capturing the three-dimensional motion of endosomes moving up to several micrometres per second.},

abstract = {Shroom3 is an actin-associated regulator of cell morphology that is required for neural tube closure, formation of the lens placode, and gut morphogenesis in mice and has been linked to chronic kidney disease and directional heart looping in humans. Numerous studies have shown that Shroom3 likely regulates these developmental processes by directly binding to Rho-kinase and facilitating the assembly of apically positioned contractile actomyosin networks. We have characterized the molecular basis for the neural tube defects caused by an ENU-induced mutation that results in an arginine-to-cysteine amino acid substitution at position 1838 of mouse Shroom3. We show that this substitution has no effect on Shroom3 expression or localization but ablates Rock binding and renders Shroom3 non-functional for the ability to regulate cell morphology. Our results indicate that Rock is the major downstream effector of Shroom3 in the process of neural tube morphogenesis. Based on sequence conservation and biochemical analysis, we predict that the Shroom-Rock interaction is highly conserved across animal evolution and represents a signaling module that is utilized in a variety of biological processes.},

Here, we show that tricellulin, which is localized at tricellular contacts, regulates F-actin organization via Cdc42. Tricellulin knockdown epithelial cells exhibit irregular polygonal shapes with curved cell borders and impaired organization of F-actin fibers around tricellular contacts during cell-cell junction formation. The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of tricellulin binds to a Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Tuba, and activates Cdc42. A tricellulin mutant that lacks the ability of Tuba binding cannot rescue the curved cell border phenotype of tricellulin knockdown cells. These findings indicate that tricellular contacts play crucial roles in regulating the actomyosin-mediated apical junctional complex tension through the tricellulin-Tuba-Cdc42 system.},

@article{Li2016,
abstract = {Geneticists have long sought the ability to manipulate vertebrate genomes by directly altering the information encoded in specific genes. The recently dis-covered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)– Cas9 endonuclease has the ability to bind single loci within vertebrate genomes and generate double-strand breaks (DSBs) at those sites. These DSBs induce an endogenous DSB repair response that results in small insertions or deletions at the targeted site. Alternatively, a template can be supplied, in which case homology-directed repair results in the generation of engineered alleles at the break site. These changes alter the function of the targeted gene facilitating the analysis of gene function. This tool has been widely adopted in the zebrafish model; we discuss the development of this system in the zebrafish and how it can be manipulated to facilitate genome engineering. The CRISPR–Cas[ 4 3 {\_} T D {\$} D I F F ] 9 System The CRISPR (see Glossary)–Cas9 system is a diverse family of endonucleases found in archaeal and bacterial genomes that have been adapted for use in engineering metazoan genomes [1,2]. The best studied CRISPR–Cas9 system is from the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes and this is the system that has been used for most zebrafish genome engineering work. The endonuclease comprises a large protein encoded by the cas9 gene and two small RNA molecules, trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) and CRISPR RNA (crRNA), that form a complex. The small RNAs are encoded by the tracr gene and cleavage products of the CRISPR repeat locus, respectively [3–7]. The complex between the Cas9 protein, the crRNA, and the tracrRNA is referred to as the Cas9 holoendonuclease. The Cas9 protein has a domain that binds to a short sequence of DNA referred to as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), but most of the DNA-binding specificity comes from base pairing between the 20-nucleotide 'spacer' domain of the crRNA:tracrRNA duplex and the target DNA strand. Successful base pairing of the spacer domain of the crRNA to the genomic DNA target activates two endonuclease domains in Cas9, each of which cleaves a single strand of the DNA target. Because the spacer provides 20 nucleotides of specificity to the holoendonuclease in addition to the two nucleotides of specificity provided by the PAM, the holoendonuclease has sufficient specificity to uniquely cleave DNA at a single site in a metazoan organism. The generation of a DSB in genomic DNA is toxic and is rapidly repaired by an endogenous DSB repair system (Box 1). One repair mechanism, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), results in small insertions or deletions at the site of the DSB. The resulting alleles are generally knockout alleles as they are predicted to ablate gene function. A second repair mechanism, homology-directed repair (HDR), uses a template, which can be supplied by the geneticist or can be the sister chromosome, to generate alleles of [ 3 6 {\_} T D {\$} D I F F ] the [ 4 4 {\_} T D {\$} D I F F ] template sequence. [ 4 5 {\_} T D {\$} D I F F ] The second[ 4 6 {\_} T D {\$} D I F F ] HDR approach is considerably more difficult than the first.},

Through protein structure determination, targeted mutagenesis, high-throughput screening, and a battery of in vitro assays, we have increased the dynamic range of GCaMP3 by severalfold, creating a family of "GCaMP5" sensors. We tested GCaMP5s in several systems: cultured neurons and astrocytes, mouse retina, and in vivo in Caenorhabditis chemosensory neurons, Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction and adult antennal lobe, zebrafish retina and tectum, and mouse visual cortex. Signal-to-noise ratio was improved by at least 2- to 3-fold. In the visual cortex, two GCaMP5 variants detected twice as many visual stimulus-responsive cells as GCaMP3. By combining in vivo imaging with electrophysiology we show that GCaMP5 fluorescence provides a more reliable measure of neuronal activity than its predecessor GCaMP3. GCaMP5 allows more sensitive detection of neural activity in vivo and may find widespread applications for cellular imaging in general.},

Little is known regarding how mechanical signals are transmitted between cells to control cell shape changes during morphogenesis. Here we provide evidence that the scaffold protein amotL2 is needed for aortic vessel lumen expansion. Using gene inactivation strategies in zebrafish, mouse and endothelial cell culture systems, we show that amotL2 associates to the VE-cadherin adhesion complex where it couples adherens junctions to contractile actin fibres. Inactivation of amotL2 dissociates VE-cadherin from cytoskeletal tensile forces that affect endothelial cell shape. We propose that the VE-cadherin/amotL2 complex is responsible for transmitting mechanical force between endothelial cells for the coordination of cellular morphogenesis consistent with aortic lumen expansion and function},

Here, we discuss genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with numerous chromatin regulators and then target these enzymatic activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent with this notion, lncRNAs can function as modular scaffolds to specify higher-order organization in RNP complexes and in chromatin states. The importance of these modes of regulation is underscored by the newly recognized roles of long RNAs for proper gene control across all kingdoms of life.},

abstract = {The directed migration of cell collectives drives the formation of complex organ systems. A characteristic feature of many migrating collectives is a 'tissue-scale' polarity, whereby 'leader' cells at the edge of the tissue guide trailing 'followers' that become assembled into polarised epithelial tissues en route. Here, we combine quantitative imaging and perturbation approaches to investigate epithelial cell state transitions during collective migration and organogenesis, using the zebrafish lateral line primordium as an in vivo model. A readout of three-dimensional cell polarity, based on centrosomal-nucleus axes, allows the transition from migrating leaders to assembled followers to be quantitatively resolved for the first time in vivo. Using live reporters and a novel fluorescent protein timer approach, we investigate changes in cell-cell adhesion underlying this transition by monitoring cadherin receptor localisation and stability. This reveals that while cadherin 2 is expressed across the entire tissue, functional apical junctions are first assembled in the transition zone and become progressively more stable across the leader-follower axis of the tissue. Perturbation experiments demonstrate that the formation of these apical adherens junctions requires dynamic microtubules. However, once stabilised, adherens junction maintenance is microtubule independent. Combined, these data identify a mechanism for regulating leader-to-follower transitions within migrating collectives, based on the relocation and stabilisation of cadherins, and reveal a key role for dynamic microtubules in this process.},

Among the best known are motors that use sophisticated intramolecular amplification mechanisms to take nanometre steps along protein tracks in the cytoplasm. These motors transport a wide variety of cargo, power cell locomotion, drive cell division and, when combined in large ensembles, allow organisms to move. Motor defects can lead to severe diseases or may even be lethal. Basic principles of motor design and mechanism have now been derived, and an understanding of their complex cellular roles is emerging.},

abstract = {Actomyosin flows are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell migration, polarization, and morphogenesis. In epithelia, flow polarization orients cell deformations. It is unclear, however, how flows are polarized and how global patterns of junction remodeling emerge from flow polarization locally. We address this question during intercalation-driving extension of the Drosophila germband. Intercalation is associated with polarized junction remodeling, whereby actomyosin pulses flow anisotropically toward dorsal-ventral junctions and shrink them. Here, we show that planar polarization of flows emerges from polarized fluctuations in the levels of E-cadherin clusters that produce transient and oscillating asymmetries of coupling. These fluctuations are triggered by polarized E-cadherin endocytosis and are amplified by flow itself. This work suggests that fluctuations and mechanical instability are not the consequences of limited control over the systems key parameters, but rather that they define the axis of symmetry breaking. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates for the first time that binding of calcium-activated calmodulin to a minimal interaction site within the disordered N-terminal domain is required for the essential Aurora-A activity in mitosis and in regulation of ciliary disassembly., The centrosomal Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) regulates mitotic progression, and overexpression and hyperactivation of AURKA commonly promotes genomic instability in many tumors. Although most studies of AURKA focus on its role in mitosis, some recent work identified unexpected nonmitotic activities of AURKA. Among these, a role for basal body–localized AURKA in regulating ciliary disassembly in interphase cells has highlighted a role in regulating cellular responsiveness to growth factors and mechanical cues. The mechanism of AURKA activation involves interactions with multiple partner proteins and is not well understood, particularly in interphase cells. We show here that AURKA activation at the basal body in ciliary disassembly requires interactions with Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM) and that Ca2+/CaM are important mediators of the ciliary disassembly process. We also show that Ca2+/CaM binding is required for AURKA activation in mitosis and that inhibition of CaM activity reduces interaction between AURKA and its activator, NEDD9. Finally, mutated derivatives of AURKA impaired for CaM binding and/or CaM-dependent activation cause defects in mitotic progression, cytokinesis, and ciliary resorption. These results define Ca2+/CaM as important regulators of AURKA activation in mitotic and nonmitotic signaling.},

abstract = {Intestinal tumorigenesis is a result of mutations in signaling pathways that control cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in the Wnt/??-catenin pathway are associated with the majority of intestinal cancers, while dysregulation of the Hippo/Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) pathway is an emerging regulator of intestinal tumorigenesis. In addition, these closely related pathways play a central role during intestinal regeneration. We have previously shown that methylation of the Hippo transducer YAP by the lysine methyltransferase SETD7 controls its subcellular localization and function. We now show that SETD7 is required for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis and regeneration. Mechanistically, SETD7 is part of a complex containing YAP, AXIN1, and ??-catenin, and SETD7-dependent methylation of YAP facilitates Wnt-induced nuclear accumulation of ??-catenin. Collectively, these results define a methyltransferase-dependent regulatory mechanism that links the Wnt/??-catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. The Wnt/??-catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways are intimately linked in structure and function. Oudhoff et al. provide evidence that the lysine methyltransferase SETD7 is a central link between these pathways. SETD7-dependent methylation of YAP is required for optimal ??-catenin-dependent gene expression. Accordingly, loss of SETD7 attenuates Wnt-dependent intestinal tumorigenesis and regeneration.},

However, the mechanisms by which growing organs can sense their sizes and stop growing when they reach their proper sizes remain poorly understood. The mechanosensory organs of the fish lateral line system (neuromasts) provide an ideal system to address this question for the following reasons. First, each superficial neuromast is composed of a small number of cells situated on the body surface, making it relatively easy to quantify organ size throughout development. Second, while the sensory cells of superficial neuromasts are continuously renewed, overall organ size is homeostatically maintained. Third, there is another type of neuromast showing an opposite mode of growth: that is, canal neuromasts increase in size in proportion to organism body size. Here, we review recent findings regarding the mechanisms that control organ size in the zebrafish lateral line.},

abstract = {The mTOR pathway is the central regulator of cell size. External signals from growth factors and nutrients converge on the mTORC1 multi-protein complex to modulate downstream targets, but how the different inputs are integrated and translated into specific cellular responses is incompletely understood. Deregulation of the mTOR pathway occurs in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), where cilia (filiform sensory organelles) fail to sense urine flow because of inherited mutations in ciliary proteins. We therefore investigated if cilia have a role in mTOR regulation. Here, we show that ablation of cilia in transgenic mice results in enlarged cells when compared with control animals. In vitro analysis demonstrated that bending of the cilia by flow is required for mTOR downregulation and cell-size control. Surprisingly, regulation of cell size by cilia is independent of flow-induced calcium transients, or Akt. However, the tumour-suppressor protein Lkb1 localises in the cilium, and flow results in increased AMPK phosphorylation at the basal body. Conversely, knockdown of Lkb1 prevents normal cell-size regulation under flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that the cilium regulates mTOR signalling and cell size, and identify the cilium-basal body compartment as a spatially restricted activation site for Lkb1 signalling.},

The development of lateral line placodes has been studied in amphibians since the early 1900s. This paper reviews these older studies and tries to integrate them with more recent findings. Lateral line placodes are probably induced in a multistep process from a panplacodal area surrounding the neural plate. The time schedule of these inductive processes has begun to be unravelled, but little is known yet about their molecular basis. Subsequent pattern formation, morphogenesis and differentiation of lateral line placodes proceeds in most respects relatively autonomously: Onset and polarity of migration of lateral line primordia, the type, spacing, size and number of receptor organs formed, as well as the patterned differentiation of different cell types occur normally even in ectopic locations. Only the pathways for migration of lateral line primordia depend on external cues. Thus, lateral line placodes act as integrated and relatively context-insensitive developmental modules.},

abstract = {The pattern of blood flow has long been thought to play a significant role in vascular morphogenesis, yet the flow-sensing mechanism that is involved at early embryonic stages, when flow forces are low, remains unclear. It has been proposed that endothelial cells use primary cilia to sense flow, but this has never been tested invivo. Here we show, by noninvasive, high-resolution imaging of live zebrafish embryos, that endothelial cilia progressively deflect at the onset of blood flow and that the deflection angle correlates with calcium levels in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that alterations in shear stress, ciliogenesis, or expression of the calcium channel PKD2 impair the endothelial calcium level and both increase and perturb vascular morphogenesis. Altogether, these results demonstrate that endothelial cilia constitute a highly sensitive structure that permits the detection of low shear forces during vascular morphogenesis. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Summary Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can survive and proliferate for an extended period of time in culture, but unlike that of tumor-derived cells, this form of cellular immortality does not depend on genomic aberrations. In this study, we sought to elucidate the molecular basis of this long-term growth property of hESCs. We found that the survival of hESCs depends on the small GTPase Rho and its activator AKAP-Lbc. We show that AKAP-Lbc/Rho signaling sustains the nuclear function of the transcriptional cofactors YAP and TAZ by modulating actin microfilament organization. By inducing reprogramming and differentiation, we found that dependency on this Rho signaling pathway is associated with the pluripotent state. Thus, our findings show that the capacity of hESCs to undergo long-term expansion in vitro is intrinsically coupled to their cellular identity through interconnected molecular circuits that link cell survival to pluripotency.},

@article{Fukuhara2014a,
abstract = {The formation of vascular structures requires precisely controlled proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs), which occurs through strict regulation of the cell cycle. However, the mechanism by which EC proliferation is coordinated during vascular formation remains largely unknown, since a method of analyzing cell-cycle progression of ECs in living animals has been lacking. Thus, we devised a novel system allowing the cell-cycle progression of ECs to be visualized in vivo. To achieve this aim, we generated a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses zFucci (zebrafish fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator) specifically in ECs (an EC-zFucci Tg line). We first assessed whether this system works by labeling the S phase ECs with EdU, then performing time-lapse imaging analyses and, finally, examining the effects of cell-cycle inhibitors. Employing the EC-zFucci Tg line, we analyzed the cell-cycle progression of ECs during vascular development in different regions and at different time points and found that ECs proliferate actively in the developing vasculature. The proliferation of ECs also contributes to the elongation of newly formed blood vessels. While ECs divide during elongation in intersegmental vessels, ECs proliferate in the primordial hindbrain channel to serve as an EC reservoir and migrate into basilar and central arteries, thereby contributing to new blood vessel formation. Furthermore, while EC proliferation is not essential for the formation of the basic framework structures of intersegmental and caudal vessels, it appears to be required for full maturation of these vessels. In addition, venous ECs mainly proliferate in the late stage of vascular development, whereas arterial ECs become quiescent at this stage. Thus, we anticipate that the EC-zFucci Tg line can serve as a tool for detailed studies of the proliferation of ECs in various forms of vascular development in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cilia formation requires intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins. Recent studies indicate that mammalian Hedgehog (Hh) signaling requires cilia. It is unclear, however, if the requirement for cilia and IFT proteins in Hh signaling represents a general rule for all vertebrates. Here we examine zebrafish ift57, ift88, and ift172 mutants and morphants for defects in Hh signaling. Although ift57 and ift88 mutants and morphants contained residual maternal protein, the cilia were disrupted. In contrast to previous genetic studies in mouse, mutations in zebrafish IFT genes did not affect the expression of Hh target genes in the neural tube and forebrain and had no quantitative effect on Hh target gene expression. Zebrafish IFT mutants also exhibited no dramatic changes in the craniofacial skeleton, somite formation, or motor neuron patterning. Thus, our data indicate the requirement for cilia in the Hh signal transduction pathway may not represent a universal mechanism in vertebrates.},

abstract = {Information exchange between different cells makes multicellular life possible. Signaling between cells can occur over long distances, as in the case of hormone signaling, or it can take place over short distances between immediately juxtaposed neighbors, as in the case of stem cell-niche signaling. The ability of signal-sending and -receiving cells to communicate with one another in a specific manner is of paramount importance in the proper development and function of tissues. Growing evidence indicates that different cellular protrusions help to achieve specificity in signaling that occurs between distinct cell types. Here, we focus on new roles for cellular protrusions in cell-to-cell communication, drawing special attention to how stem cells use specialized extensions to promote reception of self-renewing signals emanating from the niche. Cytonemes are specialized filopodia found in diverse tissues that promote signaling between specific cells over varying distances.Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) share some structural similarities with cytonemes, and can traffic diverse cargos such as mitochondria, endosomal vesicles, viruses, and Ca2+.Microtubule-based nanotubes (MT nanotubes), formed by Drosophila germline stem cells, provide an exclusive surface area for productive signaling between niche cells and stem cells.},

abstract = {Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for systems neuroscience. Here we describe red, single-wavelength GECIs, "RCaMPs," engineered from circular permutation of the thermostable red fluorescent protein mRuby. High-resolution crystal structures of mRuby, the red sensor RCaMP, and the recently published red GECI R-GECO1 give insight into the chromophore environments of the Ca(2+)-bound state of the sensors and the engineered protein domain interfaces of the different indicators. We characterized the biophysical properties and performance of RCaMP sensors in vitro and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila larvae, and larval zebrafish. Further, we demonstrate 2-color calcium imaging both within the same cell (registering mitochondrial and somatic [Ca(2+)]) and between two populations of cells: neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we perform integrated optogenetics experiments, wherein neural activation via channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or a red-shifted variant, and activity imaging via RCaMP or GCaMP, are conducted simultaneously, with the ChR2/RCaMP pair providing independently addressable spectral channels. Using this paradigm, we measure calcium responses of naturalistic and ChR2-evoked muscle contractions in vivo in crawling C. elegans. We systematically compare the RCaMP sensors to R-GECO1, in terms of action potential-evoked fluorescence increases in neurons, photobleaching, and photoswitching. R-GECO1 displays higher Ca(2+) affinity and larger dynamic range than RCaMP, but exhibits significant photoactivation with blue and green light, suggesting that integrated channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics using R-GECO1 may be subject to artifact. Finally, we create and test blue, cyan, and yellow variants engineered from GCaMP by rational design. This engineered set of chromatic variants facilitates new experiments in functional imaging and optogenetics.},

In this study, we use the zebrafish lateral line primordium (LLP), a group of migrating epithelial cells that form sensory organs, to understand how tissue growth is controlled during organ formation. Loss of the cell junction-associated Motin protein Amotl2a leads to overproliferation and bigger LLP, affecting the final pattern of sensory organs. Amotl2a function in the LLP is mediated together by the Hippo pathway effector Yap1 and the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin effector Lef1. Our results implicate for the first time the Hippo pathway in size regulation in the LL system. We further provide evidence that the Hippo/Motin interaction is essential to limit tissue size during development.},

Cell geometry has been known to be another determinant of spindle orientation and recent results have shed new light on the link between cellular shape and cell division orientation. The importance of controlling spindle orientation is manifested in neurodevelopmental defects such as microcephaly, tumor initiation as well as defects in tissue architecture and cell fate misspecification.

abstract = {The architecture and adhesiveness of a cell microenvironment is a critical factor for the regulation of spindle orientation in vivo. Using a combination of theory and experiments, we have investigated spindle orientation in HeLa (human) cells. Here we show that spindle orientation can be understood as the result of the action of cortical force generators, which interact with spindle microtubules and are activated by cortical cues. We develop a simple physical description of this spindle mechanics, which allows us to calculate angular profiles of the torque acting on the spindle, as well as the angular distribution of spindle orientations. Our model accounts for the preferred spindle orientation and the shape of the full angular distribution of spindle orientations observed in a large variety of different cellular microenvironment geometries. It also correctly describes asymmetric spindle orientations, which are observed for certain distributions of cortical cues. We conclude that, on the basis of a few simple assumptions, we can provide a quantitative description of the spindle orientation of adherent cells. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},
